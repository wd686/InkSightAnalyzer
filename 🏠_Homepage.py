This platform offers an interactive exploration of SSIC classification results, \
from overall accuracy metrics to detailed company-level analyses. \
Users can leverage the Prediction pages to input custom company descriptions, \
allowing the model to generate and return the most relevant SSIC codes based on the specified hierarchical level. \
Additionally, the Reference pages provide a quick search feature for SSIC codes, \
enabling users to gain a deeper understanding of their applications.

**Results**\n
This section presents the overall classification results as well as SSIC results at the company level. \
It is particularly useful for validating companies' declared SSIC codes against the recommended SSIC codes.


**Prediction (Section)**\n
This section enables users to apply the classification model to ad-hoc company descriptions, returning the top SSIC codes at the Section level. \
It is ideal for conducting quick analyses to obtain the recommended SSIC codes at the Section level.

**Prediction (Division)**\n
This section enables users to apply the classification model to ad-hoc company descriptions, returning the top SSIC codes at the Division level. \
It is ideal for conducting quick analyses to obtain the recommended SSIC codes at the Division level.

**Prediction (Group)**\n
This section enables users to apply the classification model to ad-hoc company descriptions, returning the top SSIC codes at the Group level. \
It is ideal for conducting quick analyses to obtain the recommended SSIC codes at the Group level.

**Prediction (Class)**\n
This section enables users to apply the classification model to ad-hoc company descriptions, returning the top SSIC codes at the Class level. \
It is ideal for conducting quick analyses to obtain the recommended SSIC codes at the Class level.

**Prediction (Sub-class)**\n
This section enables users to apply the classification model to ad-hoc company descriptions, returning the top SSIC codes at the Sub-class level. \
It is ideal for conducting quick analyses to obtain the recommended SSIC codes at the Sub-class level.


**Reference (Section)**\n
This section allows users to search across {section} SSIC Section codes and its related keywords in SSIC titles. \
The search results will provide a relevant list of SSIC Section codes and titles based on the input terms. \
This feature is ideal for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the meanings and applications of each SSIC Section code.

**Reference (Division)**\n
This section allows users to search across {division} SSIC Division codes and its related keywords in SSIC titles. \
The search results will provide a relevant list of SSIC Division codes and titles based on the input terms. \
This feature is ideal for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the meanings and applications of each SSIC Division code.

**Reference (Group)**\n
This section allows users to search across {group} SSIC Group codes and its related keywords in SSIC titles. \
The search results will provide a relevant list of SSIC Group codes and titles based on the input terms. \
This feature is ideal for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the meanings and applications of each SSIC Group code.

**Reference (Class)**\n
This section allows users to search across {Class} SSIC Class codes and its related keywords in SSIC titles. \
The search results will provide a relevant list of SSIC Class codes and titles based on the input terms. \
This feature is ideal for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the meanings and applications of each SSIC Class code.

**Reference (Sub-class)**\n
This section allows users to search across {subclass} SSIC Sub-class codes and its related keywords in SSIC titles. \
The search results will provide a relevant list of SSIC Sub-class codes and titles based on the input terms. \
