 - The original cartridges cost 3 times the compatible ones, too much detachment if they are tanks without a head.
 - Instant Ink: the printer must always be connected (energy saving?), the cost has increased and there is no difference with full color prints and a black dot, it's not good, it should be consumption-based.
 - Cashback promo: why do you write that you just need to buy a printer and then only in the regulation only some models are excluded, and not even cheap ones, so I don't understand. Not to mention the need to have a lot of purchase information within just a week.
 -HP plus, for the entire life of the printer only original cartridges, ok, maybe part of the earnings are for the cartridges, but encouraged, not forced.
 - HP support. When I was inquiring about the purchase I read some less than exciting things. The large groups today also diversify for good customer care, I hope they are wrong, but from the assumptions, for example if I wanted to sell the printer with HP plus could I do it or would I bind the buyer?

For that alone I'd give HP a score of 9 out of 10.
But, I'm unsure about what I've signed on for with HP Ink. I've received printer cartridges at the appropriate times. But the I find the issue of printing paper confounding. I recently received a box of several reams of HP paper even thought I'm nowhere close to using up the reams in the original box. And I'm unsure about how you determine the number of sheets of papers I've used. After I had ordered HP paper, I was still using the remainder of what I had in hand. Did HP charge me for that? Can the company provide a simple outline of how the paper provision system works? If I had an indication of just what my monthly payment is buying I'd give HP a higher grade.

The numbers are so small that I would often press the wrong number.  It is very difficult to read.  There have been various page feeder problems.  I was originally signed up for the instant ink. 
 This didn't work for my needs because I was more stressed by the ""watching the number of pages printed"" which was never accurate/up to date.  I finally got rid of it after the trial period.  During the trial period, with all of the problems that I experienced, a supervisor said he would send me an ink cartridge for all of my trouble.

My printer connected to a wireless card on my desktop over Bluetooth due to the  proximity of my desktop.  Luckily I have an IT back ground in desktop support so connecting laptops/PCs to printers was just a matter of troubleshooting the issue after 2 hours, I was getting a little frustrated, but having patience is part of my job. 

A friend of mine however, had a similar issue with one of your new HP inkjet wireless printers, which she purchased this year, she was so frustrated when she asked me to help, she was going to return the print device.  After 2 hours, I finally, had to download software from the HP support website and connect a USB cable from her printer to her laptop.  Only after this, we were able to have the laptop communicate with the printer.   So first thing you need to do is fix the wireless issue.  You will lose sales if you don't.  Better instructions should be included especially what possible cables may be needed, to complete setup.  I know you asked about my printer but there are older people that don't necessarily have an IT background and they will return the equipment rather than trying to understand an offshore technician over the phone.    

My printer once I got it connected works well, whether I use my phone, tablet, desktop, and laptop. It uses hardly any ink for even the most color graphic print outs.  Very economical, if someone tells me they are considering buying another printer and they're even thinking about an inkjet, I tell them to consider a tank printer.  My last printer was an HP Officejet that lasted for 7 years.  I originally paid $100 for it brand new out of the box.  The after costs in buying ink cartridges, probably brought my ""$100"" to a ""$1,100"" printer.   

The tank printer is a little more expensive, up front cost but I was willing to pay as much as $275 for a printer.  I know I would have already paid $120 in ink if I had purchased the inkjet.  My tank printer has just recently got to the point were, I can see the level of ink in the ink display windows.

The first representative discovered that my replacement printer came without “start up”. cartridges so the replacement printer would not print with the regular cartridges.  He tried several things but nothing would work. He spoke to his supervisor and the suggestion he came back with was for me to send  this printer back and they would send another one. That would mean I was going to be sending the broke printer back as well as the new replacement printer.  That was not acceptable.  I needed a printer and I had waited for about a week for the replacement printer.  I did not want to hear that I had to wait 7 days to two weeks for another printer.  He went and spoke with his supervisor and returned with a method of overriding the preprogrammed printer.  To my pleasant surprise it worked.  The representative named Aamir refused to give up.  His heart was in helping me the customer with the printing problem that was created by the people responsible for shipping a replacement printer to me without the specially programmed ink cartridges. We spent a lot of time on this issue and I was exhausted after we finished but I was happy that I was lucky enough to get Aamir who was determined to help me get this printer started. He got 6 stars from me.

The second representative did a great job as well because the next day the printer wouldn’t print.  He too was very thorough. He found the problem and took off the baggage  electronically that was preventing the printer from printing.  Both men were examples of excellence from your company!!!!!

 On the one hand, the printer is good, it is fast and complete, but when you choose an HP you do not choose for the printer (since there are many on the market with the same features and cheaper), but for its HP Instant Ink service.
 It is because of this other side, this service, that for the moment, I give it a fail.
 Their ink replacement service is slow. It is well thought out that the printer warns of low ink through Wi-Fi, but its delivery must be faster and more express, since this low ink warning does not provide many more pages.
 It takes 10 days for the ink to arrive, which leaves that billing of ""one month"" to print ink (which HP boasts) in actually less than a month, because the ink takes a long time to arrive.

- setting up was not easy.  Getting to talk to a customer service rep was a large challenge.
- have tried the 6 months free ink to see what we thought, but it was not easy, replacements do not come within time for replacing.  Why?  Why not send the replacement as soon as we install the new ink cartridges?  Why wait?  Then when we have to print multiple pages for a project, we are out of ink.
- the paper feed many times pulls in multiple pages.  Therefore, I am wasting ink and paper because we need to reprint.  Very frustrating!!!  
- Ink cartridges are hard to open - when turning the cap to open it before installing into the printer.  An older person, someone with disabilities, or myself would really have a difficult time. Many times I have to use something to give me leverage to take off the orange cap. 
-  Ink cartridges have leaked numerous times when first opened.  Stains on carpets, clothes, etc.  I know I love at a higher altitude, but I wold of thought you would have tested this before going to market with this product.
- Ink cartridges have leaked when I have had them in the supplied envelope for recycling.  Leaked onto my passenger seat in my car as I was driving to the post office to drop it off.

This is an email i sent to Tech support on 24/04/2024 after speakin to them on the phone...

Hi Dusan,

I have found the case number from Tech support in January which is 5119517831 and whoever your colleague was i spoke too from instant ink in January, to told me that he had put a note on to add an additional three months onto the nine months free giving me a total of 12months for the inconvenience.

As i explained to him at the time, i replaced the instant cartridge with a new one and my printer had an error saying cartridge jam or words to that effect and when i spoke to tech support they told me the printer had failed and was broken so i purchased the new printer but just before i was about to set up the new printer i tried the faulty one and found it had started working again so when i called technical support again he apologised for telling me the old printer was faulty so giving me the extra 3 months, although i wasn't very happy about it as i had just purchased a new printer for over £180.00 when i didn't have too and i tried to send it back to the company where i purchased it but they would not accept it back due to me opening the box.

Hope this helps and gets resolved.

Regards
