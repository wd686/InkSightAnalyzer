It started with an ""ADF"" paper jam message before any paper had been introduced into the printer.  I am still getting this massage which will then not allow me to print or scan documents until I open the document feeder and the scanning bed before printing.  There is no paper in the ADF during these occasions.  During initial setup, It also said that the print cartridge carriage was jammed and unable to move.  While talking to HP tech support I noticed that the gray top on the print cartridge carriage was loose.  I opened the carriage top and successfully snapped the cover down while waiting for another solution from the tech rep.  It solved the carriage problem. The gray cover had apparently been left unfastened during factory assembly and was not covered in any of the setup instructions.

"Your company seems to be like the mafia. You're going to treat your ""customers"" as poorly as possible while squeezing as much money as possible out of them.

I just bought this new printer which was fucking horrible to set up because your fucking phone robots won't allow me to speak with anyone and then everyone I talked to wanted to pass the buck to someone else. What a shitty and horrible entity HP has become.

I pulled my old printer off of Instant ink but it doesn't come off right away, no, it takes time and your company decided to overcharge for the removal. What pure fucking scum.

Also, the page plans you offer are bullshit. There's a big unnecessary jump between plans.

I have come to hate HP as much as Comcast. What a bunch of pure fucking scumbags.

It could easily be so different. You obviously need a change in management.

"The printer works well, but the Ink program which you are nearly forced to join in order to get the printer to work is a horrible business practice. You don't people that HP will disable the HP printer if you aren't a current participant. You never shipped ink - ever!!!

I'm sure this will never be replied to nor publicly posted to warn other unsuspecting buyers. NO LONGER an HP fan.",Negative,367931454,Others,Negative,Negative

"This system is impossible to install using your instructions (had to have your technician do it with video control), at one time the printer 'ate' a piece of paper (looked everywhere; never did find it, is it a fire hazard ?), periodically it disconnects itself from the computer path, often after it disconnects (and I reconnect)  it sets the print count to something other than '1' after it had just run '1', it makes a clunking sound while it is running copies and this is all while running photos.

So I finally determine that I should use the plan I didn’t sign up for and then the ink sent to me didn’t work. Tech support took hours. Turn it off again, on again, clean out the paper jam that wasn’t there, clean the ink cartridges, blah blah blah. 

Then it thought there was a paper jam when there wasn’t. But couldn’t clear the error so it was unusable for months. Again a long call to tech support. Hours of my time to fix a paper jam that didn’t exist. 

And then the ink runs out. Subscription service fails for multiple reasons… can’t locate the printer, new credit card can’t be found, old credit card expired. Tried to close the account altogether and it got stuck in internet land for a year. Couldn’t open a new one because the old one wouldn’t close. 

Tried to buy ink outside of subscription but that’s not allowed. New ink I spent $$ on doesn’t work… because I have a subscription that I can’t access because it’s stuck in cancel purgatory. It won’t cancel and yet I can’t access the account. And I can’t sign up for a new account because I already have an account. Printer dead in the water for another few months. Who has time for this? 

Customer service doesn’t care. Says I can sell it on Facebook marketplace if I don’t like it. Nothing else can be done.",Negative,368087210,Customer Service,Negative,Negative

I dislike the fact that I can't use what is left in the ink cartridges if I cancel my subscription. I should be able to use what ink is left and just not get any new cartridges sent to me. As everyone's knows the cost of everything has gone up so paying a subscription for ink was one of my first things to be cut to save costs. I however homeschool and still needed to print but being able to buy ink as needed was the situation I found myself in because every dollar counts when feeding a family. I have most of an ink cartridge left that is just useless to me now because I couldn't afford the auto shipments. If I was able to use the ink until that was done I would absolutely love and recommend this printer to everyone but since I can't I have actually told people not to buy it.,Negative,368098287,Price,Negative,Negative

"You know why. You're obviously, obviously a business based on selling ink not printers. Ink at exorbitant prices. You actively prevent alternative sources of ink being used. Your ink however does not last at all, you sell astronomically small amounts of ink for the price of the printer itself. Its a scam, it is obvious to anybody and I regret buying your crap. If I knew this was the case I would have never. And no I dont care to pay a ink subscription, were you actually mad when you thought that up? Whats the point? Is ink really that expensive that you hoped to save money tricking people into a subscription they dont need? Just sell the efing ink at normal prices, this is so dumb, you would literally make more money if you sold the ink at a small profit because people would be buying more and printing more.

There should be an option to pre-purchase extra print pages per your ink plan before beginning to print a document, especially when the number of pages needed is already known.

"I installed this printer because my old (formerly reliable HP) was acting crazy. It was time for a new one. The 4100 worked fine for a day or so, then has been constantly becoming ""disconnected"" no matter what I do. No other devices in the house are disconnecting from the Internet or from my MacBook Pro. I tried powering down the router several times and occasionally it'll come to life. But why in the world would anyone have to traipse all the way downstairs to cycle power on their router/bluetooth  device? It's insane. I am putting off calling for help because I'm so frustrated, I have to calm down!

Also, I really hate the tiny operator control panel. It's so dark, I can barely read it! Why doesn't it light up more? And the icons are so non-intuitive. Why can't we have words on it like the past models? My old one was a 5200 I think. In that series anyway. 

I love that it's light. The IQ is good. And even though the cartridges are harder to put in (so tucked into the mainframe that it's a little awkward), I managed to do that okay. 

If anyone wants to call to set up an appointment to help me, I'd be happy to oblige.

1. Since Instant Ink is a postpaid plan, Cancellation requests take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will receive one final monthly charge.
2. Instant Ink cartridges will no longer work after this final month of service ends, and you will need to buy retail cartridges and replace Instant Ink cartridges to continue printing.
3. Rollover pages and free month will be lost. Time: 4:19 PM

I couldn't buy the printer online, I had to call, once I called the service person took way too long to resolve the issue of shipping & billing addresses being different when paying with a credit card. Now this is way too complicated to just remove a printer from the plan. I feel like HP was not the best choice in this purchase. Time: 4:20 PM

You will also be able to save up to 50% being with the program rather than buying cartridges in the store that might cost you up to $30-80. No worries as your new printer will also receive a shipment when needed. Time: 4:42 PM

"Setup was a real pain. I'm pretty tech savy and usually don't have issue. Its been a year but  problem that sticks out most is lack of instructions and possible do's and don'ts and better trouble shoting. The biggest problem I had was Printer wouldn't connect to my internet and after 2 to 3 days of internet searching I figured out why. My internet was not password protected. I live in remote area no neighbors so I had it open, once I put a password on it connected. Would have been nice to know that in the instructions.  The app was a bit clichy at first and to figure things out, just had to play with it, use it, trial & error I guess you'd say.  Probably some of my problems had to do with my internet, its not the greatest, slow & up & down sometimes.  As far as the printer itself, Im pleased with it, the cost of it was reasonable and have had no mechanical issues so far, and learning to like the app and some of the useful things on it.  I am using the ink program, so far I like that. The last time I was sent ink was not sent a return envelope for the empty cartridge.  Overall I'm pleased with the printer.",Positive,368218380,Others,Negative,Negative

"You force owners of HP printers to install/use the HP Smart App. This app is 50% ink marketing ads and 49% user behavior tracking. 1% maybe, is geared toward actually printing. When theres any issue with the printer connection, the help dialog box is 3 checkboxes with obvious troubleshooting (is it ON? Gee thanks, I didnt check that!). Theres nothing remotely useful for any wrinkle in setup. Why we cant just use our printer as a normal network printer instead of installing this malware is totally beyond me. Every time you put in a new, totally overpriced, cheaply made, spyware-integrated (hey you printed a page! Wanna buy more ink? Buy more ink!!) Ink cartridge, the thing kicks out a calibration manifesto automatically that uses up half your new ink. Theres no way to disable this helpful calibration page. Every single component in this printer is the absolute cheapest breakable version possible. Its loud when it prints; its ugly, reminding one architecturally of east german brutalism. It sings annoyingly with a chime when somehow you get it to do the basic task of printing a page.",Negative,368246215,Others,Negative,Negative

"Hello,

The printer itself works fine. I believe it's our third printer in recent years. So, we consider ourselves loyal clients.

The main issue we have is with the ink. The cartridges are ridiculously expensive. But tired of receiving blocked messages for using alternative ink, we recently subscribed to your Instant Ink program. 

What a disapointment that has been. We ordered the suggested initial order and HP can't even get that right! The order was placed directly on-line through your app and 10 days later, still no sign of the order or evidence that the product has even been shipped. 

How frustrating. We tried to encourage HP and it's a total flop. I understand it's difficult to match the Amazon next day service but 10 days and still no information available. Really? Customer service didn't have any answers today. Polite, yes, but doesnt help us replenish our empty ink cartridge. And let me tell you, B&W print outs for work / client purposes, not too impressive.

We are not complainers but I received the survey email and since you asked, here's our feedback. 2/10 simply because the idea of Instant Ink is convenient. But overall, as an experience, what a failure. 

We will evaluate our options over the next day or two, then make a decision on our subscription.

Please and thank you,
Andre

"The 2 HP printers I purchased have both been erratic in their performance. Sometimes they will work and sometimes they don’t. One is at my condo in Palm Springs and the other at my condo in Los Angeles. Both locations have WiFi service. I use my iPhone to connect with both printers to make copies and at times to scan and send documents.

I’ve tried disconnecting and then reconnecting the power to the printers, making sure that the ink level is full, that the paper in the drawer is adequately stocked. Sometimes the printers will then work, but currently each one is now unresponsive to commands to print documents.

First the scanner wouldn’t let me scan to phone or my computer . I read the instructions checked in forum . I prepare taxes and being able to scan multiple pages is important . The print counter is aweful I will never buy hp again . I accidently copied a blank page and so no ink was used but still those printed pages were counted. The last thing I want is for a printer to monitor my print and the amount I print. It’s ridiculous to have a subscription to only print a certain amount.

I paid a lot for this printer, and now it's just an expensive paperweight. (The way it's designed, you can't buy it, you can only rent it after a HUGE downpayment - the original purchase price.) I will NEVER purchase another HP product. HP is more concerned about milking their customers for money than building a durable, eadily useable product. (You screwed me once.

"I have had nothing but problems with this printer. It is always trying to force me to purchase ink on a plan. I get that HP wants to sell authentic HP ink, but I DON'T want to purchase on a schedule. My family needs a printer, but not on a regular basis. It is NOT a good business model to prevent your product from working if the customer doesn't purchase manufacturer's ink. It also loses connecting with my wifi about once a month. Sometimes when it has been in sleep mode for a while it won't wake up and I am forced to power it off and back on again. There is also frustration with the lack of information when there is an error (which it seems to throw a lot of errors). I don't want your HP app, I just want my printer to print when I ask it to. I get that you think using your app and your ink and your plan will make my experience better, but you need to understand that not all of your customers are businesses or need a printer on a daily basis.",Negative,368647746,Product Quality,Negative,Negative

I am 70 years old, and on a fixed income. I called HP and told them my needs for a printer, could they recommend one. The lady on the phone said get the 8034e. So i looked it up and Amazon while we were talking. It was selling it for 150.00, HP was selling it for 250.00.
I asked the lady why should I buy this printer from you for 100 dollars more than Amazon is selling it for? She said she would give me free instant ink for the life of the printer.
I agreed to buy it. 6 months later i receive a bill for 7.00 for instant ink. I have gone thought several of your team members, all of them say they will exoculate the problem.
Then I don't hear from anyone. So all I am asking for is my 100.00 dollars back that I was cheated out of. If i do not receive it buy April 12,2024, I will have my sister video tape me smashing the printer with a sledge hammer. I will put this on every social media net there is.

"As a retired HP IT Pro, the OfficeJet Pro 8034e is the best ink jet printer I have ever had (working or retired).  I didn't give the experience a 10 because (1) HP makes it overly difficult to migrate from a prior Instant Ink-enabled printer to a new one and (2) HP Instant Ink packaging for the shipped replacement cartridges is terrible (insufficient protection allowing cartridges with broken locking tabs to arrive, necessitating a trip to Office Depot and out-of-pocket cost for the needed cartridge).  Also, the HP Smart software doesn't give sufficient flexibility (e.g., always pushes in the UI to assign a password, which is rarely needed by a consumer with a secure wired/wireless network at home).

Like most home users, I don’t use my printer a great deal so with the free ink trial, I got one refill of black ink. Compound this with the fact that the black cartridge that comes with it is minimally filled and you’ll get some idea of the quantity I print. Right after the trial ended I needed to print again and was out of black ink. I installed the purchased cartridge and it will NOT print black at all. I’ve been through all the troubleshooting steps in the app and the HP website and all point to to replacing the cartridge. Unfortunately, because it’s been so long since my Staples purchase, returning it isn’t available.

Not only is that stupid, it also means HP has access to everything we print, when we print and how much.  YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!    So with that, NEVER an HP product again.  2.  The deceptive INK program.  My wife cancelled at the 6 months then found out the printer won't work until she buys more ink, had she know that she would have used the printer to use up the last cartridges of ink.

This one has given me trouble in hooking up the wireless WiFi.  It ran out of ink within 2 months of buying and I had to buy more cartridges. I had barely used it.  Now, the printer doesn’t print every time and shows Message that says my computer is not hooked up to my printer.  I’ve had to have my son and son in law come fix it and hook it up to WiFi again.

I put the cartridges in with the double pack. One colored and one black. It took about fifteen minutes to print five pages. That is when I noticed the error msg in the printer window. Since I had two black cartridges I went to try out my extra black cartridge to see if it worked and that would let me know the colored one was defective. Then the extra black cartridge did not fit. I am disabled and don’t get out a lot. I would please like three replacement cartridges and I will hand over the other three that I ordered to the person that delivers my orders. I am a longtime faithful customer. I have placed about 10 orders within the past week or so. I always mostly satisfied but very disappointed with this one and I need replacements. I even received an order today and expecting another tomorrow. That is how faithful a customer that I have been. I order almost everything on line because I am disabled. That is why I don’t get out to be returning. In the past if I happen to receive something that does not work for me instead of returning I normally give it away but these cartridges are something that I need asap to print out documents.

My other issue is that the text placement on paper isn't always accurate. I did adjust the thingie in the printer to the paper size, but it often cuts of the things that were supposed to be on the bottom of the page and I have to waste paper and my monthly page limit to reprint.

"This is an old printer that was sold as an up-to-date printer on Amazon. When I went to register it on the website, it was said to be out of date with no new software!!! I had just paid hundreds of dollars for it. When I was finally able to dig out of the website the appropriate software, it was very difficult to install. Connecting it to the network was very difficult and required at least three separate times turning off the router, turning off the printer, turning off the computer...My initial remarks on the Amazon website are most of the concerns. Installing My HP, all software required multiple installations to work properly. The only software that was an instant success was getting an email address for the computer. Getting the ink supply setup went easily until I had to actually subscribe to the service...this also required multiple attempts to finally succeed. Setup for the fax was again difficult with ""hidden"" features difficult to find. Setting up the computer to store faxes has not yet been possible. Even getting the all-in-one to receive a fax was difficult and I missed many faxes as a consequence. 

I have no problem whatsoever with the HP quality: print...type, pictures, all great. That is why I bought another in a long line of HP printers. My last was the Officejet Pro Plus 8600. It lasted over seven years and was wonderful until the last when it simply quit working. The new replacement for it was too expensive for me now.",Negative,369484428,Product Quality,Positive,Negative

"It's a piece of junk. I have to shut it off anon everetilme I print, instead going to the same page after a jam, it says printing for least 5 minutes then starts from the beginning, it determines how many pages it is going to print then its done, says no print jobs. For example if I set up a print job for 15 pages, the printer does 6 and stops. Also when that happens sometimes it decides to print the whole document 1 to 3 days later. The pull out tray sucks for holding legal size papers on it. I read in a blog you are aware of the situation but in so many words that meant deal with it. The feeder for scanning or copying is so small if you are scanning you have to make three saves vs 1 on my other printers I have had. You setting make ink disappear like water. And if I purchase other than you ink product the ink level indicator doesn't function. The Adobe system to set up to use for printing whether I use your ink or generic makes the ink last double than using your program. There are many other things especially with your customer service but I don't wast my anxiety to kick in.",Negative,369651581,Customer Service,Positive,Negative

ALSO, when I change paper to put in envelopes or legal size paper: the printer clicks, clacks, buzzes, clicks some more, thunk, thunk, clack and finally is ready to print.  I suspect it sucks in a little ink in the process but I'm not sure.  The main reason I chose this printer is that it does not force me to put in a color cartridge to print in black and white, like Epson does.  I am fully aware that the function of a printer is to sell HP (only) ink, but for me, I want printouts, envelopes, labels.  I don't want your ink program.

"Your business model is selling ink cartridges. I got that. The technology you offer for the price point is incredible. You seem also to be expanding into the cloud information market, however that works. That must be the reason for the insistence on networking, WiFi, probably other sneaky little apps that tell you, about me. Cookies are the least of it.

The reference guide (closest thing I found to an owners manual in the package) is a joke. Could you at least have a site on your webpage (that address printed on the carton somewhere, not buried  in the whole corporate shebang website.

It's real nice you have the whole process automated for technological incompetents, like myself. It's nice. When it works. It's not so nice when it doesn't. 

I have been wrestling 4 days, on 2 computers getting this thing setup. I think I mostly have it, by stumbling around in the dark. You want to know why 5 out of 10? I think I am being generous.

A USB cord would have been real handy-and I know you are actively cautioning against using it. I don't even know if USB-A to USB-A patch cords are even available. but at least a note on the packaging would have been nice 1. that the machine has that option, and 2. you have to provide it on your own.

I think that about covers it. And don't pester me with regularly scheduled popups about the need for warranty checkups, like all my other HP stuff does. I like HP products generally.

"I purchased a new HP printer locally that I couldn’t get to work, even with the help of some tech savvy friends.  After a few months, I hired a computer technician in hopes of solving the problem.  He couldn’t but set me up with a phone conference with one of your technicians.  On Feb. 22/23, I spoke for 3 hours with someone who was very good but still could not identify the problem.  He arranged a followup call on Feb. 24/23 with Emma who discovered that the printer had the wrong ink cartridges, and not only that, they were all empty.  This was curious as I had never used the printer which had come in a factory-sealed box.  Emma helped me order the proper cartridges and when they arrived, on March 24 I spoke to Jim who helped me install them and finally get the printer working.
I paid $274.01CAD for the printer but with the local technician’s fees and the extra ink I had to buy, the printer ended up costing me over $600CAD.  
All of your technicians that I spoke with were wonderful, so knowledgeable and patient.  I really like your HP Instant Ink Plan.  It’s so reasonable as we pay an atrocious price for ink in our small town.  Thank you.",Positive,369925875,Price,Negative,Positive

"1 - Biggest frustration so far is that you gave me a trial and free copies for each month of that trial.  However you have removed a lot of those free copies (not rolled over).  I was busy during the first few months after buying this, so I lost a lot of free copies that didn't roll over.  Kind of rude to take away copies if you really want to keep me going forward. I lost probably 100 free copies. 
2 - VERY ANNOYED that the printer just starts making noise for no reason at all.  Sounds like it's going through a reset even though I haven't used it for a few hours. If 
I try to print as this happens, nothing prints. Has happened about 10x since getting printer. Only way to stop it is to unplug and restart.  Why? There's also times that the print job doesn't print, have to cancel and reprint.  Not good if you are printing a coupon that is a ONE TIME print.  I lost coupons due to printer not printing. 

3 - why not have words 'color' and 'black and white' on printer for copying? At first didn't know which was color copy button. Trial and error. Should have more features on the printer. 
4 - any calls into HP are very time consuming. 
5 - So far, during the free trial, I haven't yet had to replace the cartridges considering cartridges never last.  Usually cartridges in the past never last this long. 
These types of printers are never long lasting, please make ones that last a long time.  Hard to see ones that are thrown out way too often. Have a recycling program set up with Best Buy stores.",Negative,369927873,Product Quality,Negative,Negative

"The printer was easy to set up and easy to use.  The scan and print quality has been excellent.  The Instant Ink program has also been helpful and is affordable.

There have been two downsides to my experience with this printer:
1) One set of new Instant Ink cartridges didn't work, but the printer diagnostics weren't able to catch it and I spent hours trying to solve the problem and lost a day of work and wages (I work from home). I finally decided to take those new cartridges out and install others, but because I had a work deadline to meet, I couldn't wait for another set of cartridges to arrive in the mail, and had to go purchase cartridges from the store.  When I installed those, the printer worked.  Every set of cartridges that has been mailed to me after that has worked.  

2) Every time you make an update to the HP Smart software through which we access the printer, there is no email notification, or no quick tutorial to run me through the changes.  I just get surprised that the configuration changes, and have to spend time hunting for functions that were obvious before and aren't now, and that costs me extra time when I have deadlines to meet at work. It would be much better if, every time there's an update that reconfigures the user interface, there's a quick tutorial that walks users through the changes and where to find things.",Negative,370057825,Product Quality,Positive,Positive

Hate HP. Brick your printer if you don't use an official cartridge. Say this should do 240 pages.

"First, the printer seems to print, and the print quality is ok.  Sadly, that was about the only thing that was ok.

However, it was frankly utterly ridiculous process getting it work that stops this being a 10.

It took me over 2 hours to get the printer working, and almost all of that was trying to get the software set up.  Filling after that with ink was reasonably easy.

1. The printer could not find my phone, and in spite of putting the phone on top of the printer, for 30 mins just kept telling me every few minutes ""Weak Bluetooth Connection"".  Apparently there was nothing I could do to change that.

2. For no apparent reason, the printer then started to talk to the phone. Why, I have no idea...

3.It refused to connect to the Wi-Fi network, and told me the password was incorrect, in spite of the password being EXACTLY correct.

4. Three attempts later, with the same password each time, it finally connected.

5.  The pictures in the setup guide of how to fill the tanks and the animated diagrams for this were individually useless, made even more so because the animated guide just jumped, and missed out, many / most of the essential steps.

6.  I managed to do the assembly and ink setup in spite of the instructions, not because of them.

7. In particular, the printhead alignment guide was worse than useless.

8. I then attempted to use HP Smart on the phone to set up an account, but mistyped one letter in my email. Fortunately I noticed this, and was told I could change this later.  On attempting to change this, having put in the correct email, it told me ""This username is not available"".  Attempting to re-imput the correct email, it told me ""You have changed your information too many times."" [Really - twice?] ""Please try again later"". 

As you can probably gather from all of the above, my setup was anything other than easy, and taking over two hours, did not inspire any confidence whatsoever.  The clearly wrong and useless error messages didn't make the experience any better.

I was thoroughly delighted when I discovered that the printer would work from the Apple print software already on both my laptop and desktop, and I certainly don't intend to have anything else to do with what I consider to be bug ridden and unreliable HP Smart software.

Sadly it doesn't end there.

The web address listed on the extended warranty flyer is wrong, and leads to a dead end.

The printheads have a one year warranty, which suggests for a printer that is ostensibly warranted for 3 years and has up to 3 years worth of ink, it might be a good idea to buy a spare of each. Sadly both the black and tricolour printheads are out of stock on the HP website.

So, not a great experience so far., and hence the 3/10 score",Negative,370374951,Others,Positive,Positive
I think the printer has a nice footprint. It prints really well and set up was straight forward. Photos are great.

THEN, I tried to to print one day and it said I was locked out of using it. My credit card had gotten compromised so I had canceled it I guess HP wasn't able to get another $2 out of me so they shut down my printer, even though they'd never sent me new ink since I don't use it much.

"The printer works well.  It is fast, the prints look great and, being an all in one. it is versatile.  I love the automatic 2-sided printing and copying.  But I do have 2 issues with the printer though.  The biggest issue is the amount of color ink it uses.  I initially signed up for Instant Ink but stopped because I am not a regular enough user each month to justify it.  So, I use the regular cartridges.  I ran out of color very quickly even though I print very little color.  Nearly all I print is black and white documents.  I have printed less than 2 dozen pages with some color (not photographs) on them.  I do not understand why it uses so much color.  That is costly and a nuisance.  The second issue was with paper jams.  It was jamming quite a bit until I figured out that the paper tray holder pinches the pages too tightly from the sides when there are only a few pages left in the tray.  Once I figured that out, I made sure it had plenty of paper.  That seems to have resolved the issue.  But it shouldn't jam even if there is only 1 page left, especially since it is usually pretty difficult to clear the jam.  The reason it commonly had only a few pages in the paper tray was I was using different colors of paper on different projects so I would only load just about enough for what I was printing at the time.   Sometimes it was only 1 or 2 pages.
I do have one other issue.  That is with Instant Ink.  It sounds great but it is only good if you are fairly consistent in the number of pages you print each month.  As it is it's way too much trouble monitoring the number of pages printed trying to optimize the number of pages printed each month.  If you go over your selected amount you pay a higher price per page than your monthly rate.  It cost $1 if you go over by just 1 page.  That's ridiculous.  And going over 10 pages is $1 or 10 cents per page.  That's higher than most of the monthly plans.",Positive,370538889,Others,Negative,Negative

"Printer is great and very fast, and print quality is excellent. Scanner is very convenient and the feeder works well.

I canceled the subscription and I was able to print, for a few days. Then, it would not allow me to print because the ink cartridges were special and only for the subscription plan. I had to go spend about $100 to get all new cartridges. This is a rip off as other printers I have purchased did not have such a subscription trap. This will be the last HP Printer I purchase.",Negative,370603984,Customer Service,Negative,Negative

I struggled for ten months with the issues of ink and then gave up and bought an Epson printer. The hp will go to the dump if I can’t find someone to give it to. I got one shipment of ink after spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how to order one. (I thought hp was tracking my usage and would automatically send more ink when I was low. But I actually ran out and no ink was sent.) so I cancelled the ink subscription plan before my free trial was up and then I couldn’t print because the ink would only work with an active subscription?!? Even though it was almost brand new? Then I didn’t print anything for about 8 months because I was so upset about the ink not working. Then I needed to print something so I ordered what I thought was hp ink from Amazon but it was apparently not official hp ink so it would not work. That did it! I went out and bought an Epson printer. Seems much sturdier than the hp. Was quite a bit cheaper than the hp and the ink is about half the price of hp. I love my Epson printer!

But if I don’t go on your Ink scam then I have to replace the ink out of pocket when it quickly goes bad because I haven’t printed in a few months… When that happens I have to waste time calling your company- but at least they will mail me ink.

"Because HP is a complete pain in the ass! Installation does not work correctly with Windows 10, and certainly not with 11, and I seriously doubt HP will get it's act together with 12. I called 3x and was on the phone over SIX damned hours and even the rep had no clue what was wrong!
I wouldn't buy another HP, if I was paid. Well, maybe I'd buy it; use the money to buy ANYTHING ELSE, and throw the HP out the window, 
I think HP should be shut down, or, at the very least the entire board of directors fired, and new intelligent replacements brought in. 
Why not? EVERY purchase (hardware) has been difficult to get set-up correctly; some hardware fails, miserably within months, I had a 2 year warranty with Sams Club, that included ""In home repair"", but, HP tried to not accept it-- even with the Sam's Club rep on the phone. Several days later someone with a modicum (little) of intelligence figured out the warranty service, sent someone to replace the hard drive; despite pleading with the guy to stay, until completion, because something ALWAYS goes wrong when I'm told, ""Nothing ever goes wrong""-- it did, and he had to come back at another time. (Which delayed me getting my work done on time). 
Within 6 months THAT hard drive failed. 
So to short tell it:
1. Drivers are difficult to install.  
2. Getting a sucky-ass rep is hard enough, much less a good one. Almost impossible, actually.
3. Hardware failures.
4. Denial of services, even though it's in writing. 
5. With HP, you truly get what you pay for. More bang for your buck, but, in the end, you feel like you got shot in the head. 
6. In short, one of the single worst companies. 

Too bad, too. Prior to this millennia, HP stood behind it's product, had great customer service. An easy to find toll free number.

"I've always used HP products. My old HP all-in-one printer didn't have the ink option of instant ink program and it was using a full cartridge with just a few sheets printed because it would dry up due to lack of use. So I bought the new printer the deskjet 2700. I think. I set it up. It worked great on all three of my devices, a Chromebook, a pixel phone, and a Windows 10 computer.

When I printed a few copies successfully, a few minutes later the printer went off line yet the little blue light that says it's online was still on and it was still connected to the internet. According to my information from Xfinity doing a live connection test when I couldn't connect it and when the printer.couldn't connect it, none of my devices could connect.

I talked to several agents after 2 days of doing virtual support options that didn't lead anywhere. After hours of tech support failing I was scheduled a call back from a product specialist. That callback never came. So I called in. Got another call back that call back. Never came. Then I talked to support. They said that the printer had to be bad so I returned the printer. I was told it would be safe to order the same printer so I ordered the all-in-one 2700 desk yet again when it came i set it up successfully in a few minutes and it printed fine and I was happy but after less than 30 minutes it was offline and none of my devices could connect to it again. My router had a strong connection and was 1 ft away. One gigabyte router. My internet showed an excellent connection.

My internet has been rock solid for the last several years. I don't have any problems with any other devices and from what I can see I don't have any trouble connecting to the printer from the router. After the printer is gone off to sleep several minutes after that it goes offline to my devices but not offline to the internet yet. I get several emails from this printer and the last from HP saying it's my responsibility to keep an ongoing internet connection when I'm finding it in possible to do.

So I called support hopefully for the last time. Told him the story wasted everybody's time didn't mean to. The support agent suggested that a product specialist call me for the third time. I still haven't received that call. It's been 2 days now so am going to wait a couple more days and then I'm going to return it and I'm going to have to buy another brand I'm afraid. I would really like it if HP would read this and come through and offer some support because I would help him solve it if it was a bug I've had many years at in technical support myself. So I understand the challenge that this gives you and me because from what I read, there's a whole bunch of people that purchased this in the last month and what percentage of them are having this problem. If it's a hardware problem, I'd like to help resolve it. If not, I'd like to get another printer and if HP offers me a different brand that's similar. I would be excited to try something different. This is taken hours. Maybe 40 hours my time so far and haven't given up yet. Thanks for listening. Bye",Negative,371257107,Others,Positive,Negative

"This is the fourth 9135e printer that I've tried since my trusty 8600 bit the dust about 2/21/24.  The first I ordered from Amazon because they had faster shipping that HP did.  It never arrived, and I needed a printer, so I went down to Staples on 2/22/24 and bought one.  It wouldn't set up because of a leaky ink cartridge (cyan).  Staples replaced the printer, after much fuss with their technical support.  This printer set up but kept jamming and tearing paper during the paper picking process.  So, I called HP support and after a few hours, determined they would send me a replacement printer.  This was on 2/23/24, a Friday.  I paid for next business day (2/26/24) shipping and was told it would be delivered on 2/28/24.  2/28/24 came and went with nary a word from HP.

"It is absolutely ridiculous that a small mistake in the set up - putting blue ink in the Black ink tank, can mean that one has to go out and buy a new printer. There is no work around or easy repair. This is a design error and makes one very nervous about buying the product. Judging from the internet, I am not the only one, in a ""senior moment"" to make this error. The instructions need to be very clear at the stage and warn people that they will be buying a new printer if they make a mistake here.

The set up program - i.e. registering first as an HP customer was terrible. I gave it 1/10. I ended up in so many dead ends. Having had an HP before, I didn't know if I was already registered. Apparently, I wasn't. At the end of the registration process there was no link back to the set up program. I tried the other HP tab on my computer and it just told me to go to such and such. Again, NO link provided. I went round and round in circles getting no where. Finally I went back to the Windows store t reload the software. It told me I already had it and offered to open it for me. Then I saw the button I needed and the actual set up program was quite good, but lacks sufficient warning on the ink issue. I am told that Epson has a design that prevents you emptying the wrong ink into the tank.
The when I was asked what I would like to do to lose the case I asked for a replacement printer at cost price. All I was offered was the next model down at 18% off. I bought my original printer at 40% off and I was able to find my printer retail at a much cheaper price than you were offering on a cheaper printer! I hold you responsible for poor design and I expect you to ""share the pain"" if something like this happens.

First and foremost, the ink tank system is a game-changer. Gone are the days of constantly replacing expensive ink cartridges.

Additionally, the wireless connectivity options make it convenient to print from any device, whether it's my laptop, smartphone, or tablet.
Furthermore, the printer's reliability is unmatched. I haven't experienced any paper jams or technical issues since I started using it.

You have to use the instant ink subscription and if you try to cancel you can't use what you've already paid for on the ink in the first place so that's kind of stupid. so you can't cancel and you have to pay for pages even if you have your own pages. it's just stupid all together if I stop paying for the ink subscription for the paper and the ink if I have full ink still from the last time I paid you  I can't use it. it stops it immediately it's stupid and apparently you pay for pages so like I'm almost at my limit of being able to print some pages before they start charging me for more pages even though I have physical paper which is stupid and physical ink which is stupid. so I cannot stop that subscription no matter what if I want to be able to use my printer. and the prices keep going up too on the subscription it sucks. and I was told that I would only have to pay when they sent ink or paper out for me not a monthly subscription. I was told this when I contacted y'all about sending me the starter set up again again that I had to send back and y'all charged me to send me the right ink back. it's a monthly subscription and a charge when they have to send me ink and paper. I was told that I would only be charged when they had to send ink or paper to me because I run low which is another thing I'm upset about. Also the printing isn't very clear it's the slightest bit blurred no matter what I do and iv contacted y'all about in the past. Also it's horrible with printing colored pictures of people. If I still had the receipt I would cancel my subscription and return the printer for a printer that doesn't charge me constantly that I can still use and print however many pages I want.

"I have been an HP customer for 20 years and things are really not getting any better. If you have a really good copy machine (Office Jet Pro €400), they don't make it anymore, and the machines I bought afterward don't work. Your ink cartridges are outrageously expensive and the intended number of pages is never achieved.
 I'm using the new ink system that sends you cartridges when it's time for new ink.

"This is my second HP printer where I have subscribe to the instant ink. The print head on the first printer failed after several years. Based on my experience, I purchased the current printer. 
I was disappointed to discover that the 8025e does not scan double sided documents -- although it does copy 2 sided pages. 
I am also having issues with either my printer head or cartridges. I have cleaned the printhead multiple times and it has not solved the problem. Upon examination of the cartridges, I discovered that the color cartridges are contaminated with a dark ink. I have tried to clean them by blotting with a paper towel to no avail. 
The website does not provide any support for this issue. 
When I went to a chat and described the issue, I was told that I could talk to a person but would have to pay for the $1 initial fee, which would then be reimbursed. When I followed directions, I was then informed that I was being billed for $56. I didn't complete the purchase as it was an unexpected charge.",Negative,371331476,Product Quality,Positive,Positive

Your online auto-refill program for ink is a joke and a scam.  It is simply a method for you to collect a monthly fee for doing nothing.

"We had to replace our former printer - a HP Pro in the 8000 series which was a robust and heavy machine.   Unfortunately the printhead failed and we could not fix the machine.  We are close to retirement and was unable to spend a lot of money on a new printer and bought this one and have regretted the purchase every day.  It is made from plastic and we feel the component parts are of a poor quality.  The printer fails for the slightest reason and I have to reinstall very frequently. We have wasted so much paper as when using the wireless facility and printing from another room, we do not realise that it is printing large documents for a second time when we have instructed the printer to cancel that document.

I have been using HP printer for long time and like it. But some dissatisfactions exist with ENVY Pro 6420. One is that the color inks are dried and unable to resume them after a long unused period. It will be preferable to protect them from dryness. Another is that the life of the printer should be longer for an eco-friendly and environment-friendly product. I prefer to use them by repairing and maintaining for longer time.,Negative,371434364,Product Quality,Positive,Positive

"I'm not happy with the printer and with the cartridge policy of HP:
1. For printer 1 I opted for the subscription. You urged me several times to keep the printer on in order to keep track of the ink levels. 
The results were unacceptable flaws in the print quality. My suspicion was that keeping it on might lead to drying up of the print heads. 
When I keep the printer off when I don't have anything to print, the print quality is better. 
2. I cancelled the subscription a few weeks ago because I don't print that much but need the scanner much more. Then I needed to print a document urgently, and was surprised that the cartridges were not working any more - because of the cancelled subscription.
I had no choice than to install a new printer in a hurry, one we got with the new PC for my wife some months ago. 
3. I understand your policy to sell as many cartridges as possible. But you don't explain the nature of the first batch of cartridges and its limitations for the customer. 
4. I don't come back to my bad experience with your online support, when several customer service officers from India, all told me different stories about the problem.  Fortunately, one of them hinted at a way to solve it myself after hours of fiddling. 
5. For many years I have been a satisfied and faithful customer of HP, but the last months have been frustrating. I had already calculated to switch to Appel, but waited because of the cost.

"First, it prints well. easy to load paper and ink. The ink lasts a very long time compared to other ink cartridges I've used. My only complaint is the lack of instructions.

Just simple straight forward directions that could be looked at for reference would be very helpful.",Positive,371709104,Others,Positive,Positive

"I am not overly savvy when it comes to technology.  On my first call for help setting up, I was of the notion that when done it would work completely.  Later I found out that my copy part was not set up and so I could not copy anything.  It required another phone call.  I found it hard to get through on a phone call to get the help I needed.

Furthermore, I feel as if by buying your machine I am being owned by you as to how my machine will work as it does not come with all the software set up on it so that it is fully ready to use.  

Also, I have to bow down to you regarding ink and enter into a business arrangement where I will not have help with my machine if I do not get ink only from you.  Also, in getting ink directly from you, I have to keep track of how much I am printing to know what plan to buy without falling short of getting ink if I need it sooner than i had expected or paying for a large plan and not get all the ink I paid for if I had a slack time printing.  I have periods of not needing to print hardly anything and then periods where I am doing a project and do a huge amount of printing.  You hold over me that I have to pay more to get less ink if I buy at a local store.  Why can't you offer your customers the option to get the same cartridges with the same amount of ink at the same price at stores as by mail.

I find this frustrating and disappointing.  Therefore, I do not feel I would be doing right to family and friends to recommend their get an HP printer.

I am sure you are thinking you have done a wonderful thing, however, it has not helped to make a seamless trasition from an old printer to your new system.",Negative,371748702,Others,Negative,Negative

"I signed up for the “free” ink program. I received one complete set of ink cartridges. After six months and only one refill, I knew a subscription didn’t make sense. So I refused the offer to continue. Around the time period was up, I needed to do some urgent printing. And what happened? You ceased my printer and sent me an email that I had to return the cartridges. I had discarded the box and had no idea where to send them. I tried to research the address on your website and sent an email to customer service. Nothing! In the meantime, when I was desperate to have a working printer, it was frozen. I quickly ordered ink from Amazon but when it arrived I realized it was not the HP brand. Because I really needed to print documents, I installed the ink. Nope! I received the very self-serving message that it was not genuine HP ink so would not work.  So then I had to order again.

Wish the scanning bed was a full 14"" to cover legal size but then The paper tray would be much bigger so I'll deal with it.
Getting set up with the instant ink program was a hassle and communication w/HP a struggle.  FInally got it settled.  Seems like it will be more economical than even generic cartridges.  Sometimes I would buy an extra ink cartridge so I wouldn't run out and when I finally got to use the extra cartridge it was dried out (?) and wouldn't work  I'd have to toss it, full of ink and lost money trying to save.

Very intuitive and fast.
I had a canon Pixma and was difficult and the ink failed and was complicated to fix. The office supply man told me they do not fix this problem.
The only negative is I bought at Apple store and when I got home found out there was no ink and that is when I found I had to apply for it over the web and it counts the pages you use to see how much ink ypu have used.
I use the printer very little and am not sure I will enjoy this procedure and may end up paying more in the long run. This will totally and continually make me upset.

I bought this printer because it used the same cartridge I had with my previous printer so no waste but when it arrived it would not set up with the old cartridge.  After a long time in the phone with support we got it running with the startup cartridges and a supervisor said they would send me a new black cartridge since I was unable to use my old one. Several days later I got a package with no cartridge in it. When I called back I was told it would take a couple days for them to investigate and decide whether or not to send “ another” cartridge. I never heard back from them again. Super disappointing. I had been impressed with the support service to start and now am just super disappointed.,Negative,372296932,Product Quality,Negative,Positive

"We have had an HP Envy 5000 series which needed to be replaced.  We have used HP printers happily for many years.  The HP Envy 6032 was on offer so we thought it would be an improvement.
Sadly, we are disappointed.
1. The main issue is that there is no way to know what is happening.  I get messages occasionally saying it is in an ""Error state"" but there is no clue as to what is wrong.
2. Over the weekend I was printing a small run of pictures.  The colour cartridge ran out and there was no indication that it was running low - no error message.
3. The lights on it are quite bright.  The printer is in a bedroom and is too bright to be left on but we are told to keep the printer on all the time.
4. Why is the on off switch in such an awkward place - I presume it is to encourage us to keep the printer on but that is not going to be practical for us.
5. Sometimes when I go to print something it tells me the printer is offline when it isn't.  I have to wait for about 3 or 4 minutes and it will eventually print.
I like HP printers and have used HP Instant Ink for many years but I would not feel able to recommend this particular printer.  To be honest I regret the purchase.",Negative,372300535,Product Quality,Positive,Negative

"The value vs quality and operation are very agreeable to me. I chose one level under 10 for 2 reasons: 1). I’d have paid more for the option to have on-hand an additional set of ink cartridges; or that printer would come with a “jumbo”/largest available ink supply cartridges. 2). The “app” I found somewhat frustrating. I’m okay with current technologies but not a master. And that’s the point. I managed through it successfully, but others would not be able to compete. In addition, there seemed to be redundant emphasis on redirection to join ink refill supply program.  - - I purchased “this” printer (I own a larger and more sophisticated HP printer and HP computer system). for my Dad due to it being the most simplicity for operation. At 89 yrs., he “just wants to copy” (maybe 10 pages a month). Any printing he wants, I’ll do it for him, but such will be rare.",Positive,372338996,Others,Positive,Positive

"I am retired and not computer savvy. I found the installation instructions online and printed difficult to understand, but I persisted. After about two hours of working on it, I decided that I could not install the printer (to replace my old HP Officejet Pro 8625 which catastrophically one day lost its ""print head."") A big insight occurred when I discovered that the wifi cable went into the port covered by a decal. Removing that decal was a big insight! Still the printer could not print a job from my computer tower with Windows 10. So I gave up. Then about 2-3 hours later (true!) the printer came awake! I send it a PDF to print and it worked! Later I printed some calendar sheets I once created. That worked too! I haven't yet tried a third job, but I shall soon. 

I think I misunderstood HP's offer to supply ink cartridges and paper. I rarely print anything. If the ink and paper is shipped automatically to me, I do not need this service! I use one package of paper in a year or so. I misunderstood. I thought that I would inform HP when I needed ink or paper.

The display unit could be a little stiffer to move. When you push on display it move to easily!
The worse feature is loading the paper. My old 8600 the paper guide was surrounded by guides. This product didn’t have a guide for the 8 x 11 paper against it so it was hard to determine if paper had to be pushed forward or back of tray.",Negative,372353250,Others,Positive,Negative

My computer would not communicate with the printer at all, after it did the first time. I than reran the entry program and had a real hard time making it work. Computers are not my strong point and I get pissed off fast when things don't work right. Then it said I was out of ink, both weren't working. That was just after 2 weeks.

What I will say is I am very pleased with it so far, looks good, well made, and good value for the money.

"I absolutely would never ever ever recommend your product for one reason, Inkjet!!!! they are the biggest rip off of anyone out there. I can’t get replacement cartridges because they say I have only printed a few pages. But what they failed to take into account is that every time I had to get back on the printer. I had to go back through them and do a bunch of stuff and they printed five or six or seven pages every time I did this, they’re the ones that used up on my ink so I never got any free ink and my six months is almost up. I ended my relationship with inkjet and to think that they charged me every month to be a part of this! It is supposed to be free ink you’re not supposed to get charged  I tell everybody not to buy your printer because of inkjet. I don’t even know how to get them off the damn printer I’m gonna go buy my own ink cartridges and put them in and hopefully that will get rid of them. Horrible company and absolute horrible, horrible company just another example of doing nothing, and expecting to get paid , they did nothing absolutely zero for the six months that I’ve had the printer and they expect to get paid every month and if they don’t get the dollar 99 they shut my printer down. What the hell they held my printer hostage because I switched debit cards because I lost one on vacation. I was waiting on a new card so I couldn’t use my printer. I would never have bought your printer. Had I known I had to deal with inkjet if I were you I’d end my relationship with them because they never give the free ink.

I thought she was being absolutely ridiculous but guess what? They did!! Why would you give inkjet the ability to shut down a printer I flipping OWN?

"- SHOW (simple fold down/in design, angles, color), BUT DEFINITELY A “NO-GO” with me!! 
- NOT USER FRIENDLY for elders or those not computer/tech savvy & those w/visual challenges
- little 1/2” display dark gray and barely can see/read messages when screen display could’ve been made wider UTILIZE 3/4ths TOP/BOTTOM OF SPACE ON LEFT SIDE OF PRINTER FOR A VERTICALLY LONGER & WIDER DISPLAY PANEL, EASIER TO READ/ACCESS MENU w/PULL DOWN OPTIONS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE FUNCTIONS, reset wifi code, realign printer, etc. MAKING PRINTER USER FRIENDLY & READABLE for  consumer to simply turn head to LONG/WIDE DISPLAY PANEL simply read landscaped short phrase messages, instructions, MENU options … 
- I SELDOM USE READING GLASSES BUT NEEDED TO USE SAME AND MAGNIFYING GLASS AND LIGHT FROM PHONE CUZ IT’s TOO DARK/small to read!! 

- VERY INSENSITIVE, IGNORANT, ARROGANT re: different ages, computer competency & tech levels of consumers assuming printer is for young, techies, avid smart phone users? 
-  WHERE’S THE HARD COPY MANUAL? Esp w/this printer having THE MOST DIFFICULT INSTRUCTIONS/TRICKS to do for simple functions,  shows LAZINESS/HALF-ASS & TOO CHEAP, TOTAL DISREGARD & DISRESPECT  FOR CONSUMER TO EASILY INCLUDE a hardcopy in the box OR OPTION TO REQUEST A COMPLIMENTARY COPY OF SAME when registering the printer?  Consumer can leisurely flip pages & have instructions on-hand if/when needed vs needing to access phone for i instructions!  

TIMES HAVE CHANGED, Does HP have a quality control/consumer-industrial psychology-testing dept w/a diverse spectrum of subjects to test/review products BEFORE & AFTER bugs/cons are fixed, product finalized, and PRIOR TO mass producing/distributing same? 

Wish i was part of that dept & test group subjects … btw, was printer available in black? 

IF TOO DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE a HARD VOPY MANUAL, what about making a big cheat sheet to adhere on backside of paper tray with quick fixes, frequently used functions instructions, website for the manual orTECH HELP contact info. with QR code AND TECH HELP DESK TEL NUMBER?!!   

- used printer maybe 2x? What a waste of $, time. No wonder it was a bargain. You get what u pay for … 

- I HATE IT! I WANT TO RETURN/TRASH IT & get an easier to set-up/use EPSON, BROTHER or even CANON!

- WTH?!! can’t even make simple copies like other printers where one can just turn on, press black circle icon for B&W copy or colored circle for color printed vopy!! 

- had Hp back in the ‘90’s & liked it… over the years used above referenced multi function wifi simple & office caliber printers w/no issues! 

- feel trapped w/HP, tried this HP interested in the ink program only to discover that ink tuns out fast (worse than Canon but such waa for photo printing so u understandable) ! 
-  HP said my ink was running out so sent ink replacement carttidges but i waited almost 2 weeks for a replacenent cartidges,,,WTH when i need ink ASAP w/in a day or two like how AMAZON & WALMART+ delivers?!!

- Unless HP can deliver ink cartridges faster, can HP give vouchers on phone or paper ones when enrolling in ink program (esp when awaiting ink to print) w/options to pick up at designated locations (Office Max, Office Depot, Fisher Hawaii, collab w/Amazon local cust svce/return sites at Whole Foods & soon Amazon warehouse in Honolulu.?

My son came to help, figured out how to get messages from the printer. I learned that because my account for automatic delivery of printer ink had a problem, the printer would not print. And the printer didn’t even need ink! I updated that info. And now sometimes, it will print from my iPad, but not my Samsung phone.
I just wanted a printer that would print and this one it too difficult. I’m a retired widow and just print knit and crochet patterns and occasional receipts. The receipts I needed for taxes had to be emailed to my son and he printed them and brought them to me.

Because it was easy to install and set up myself. The printer runs diagnostics on itself which makes finding out what is wrong easy to figure out how to fix the problem.

First- I appreciated the period when I got ink free - so I signed up for automatic restocking.  The issue is not with the service but the cost.

The only two factors that redeem the 2755e are its decent scan quality and its light weight. I have used HP printers for many years and have generally found them reliable and high quality. But not this one. HP should pull it from the market immediately and seriously rethink its customer expectations.",Negative,373264485,Customer Service,Positive,Positive

I have had to uninstall it on my computer because the ""driver not found"" or something similar to that and getting it reinstalled and paired with computer is a nightmare and time hog.  It would be so very nice to have a phone number to talk to a live person that speaks clear understandable english.  And since I have had to reinstall it on my computer, I am receiving emails ""to finish setting up my printer"" when even as this email says, I have had it a year and have been paying for HP instant ink membership.  My phone number is 325.668.4723 if your company would like to call me to and set up a time that we can clear up these issues.

"I never intended to purchase a printer that HP would count and bill me for the number of times I used the printer function. All I wanted was a printer I could use as much as I wanted understanding I would buy printer cartridges as needed. I would never have purchased the current printer had I known this. I’m planning to discard it and buy another printer brand without all the cumbersome monitoring. No, I do not recommend HP to my friends.",Negative,373433888,Others,Positive,Positive

"I need a printer I can count on.  Dont use printer for extended times in between and bought this one largly for 3 in 1 use as copy/scanner, but when I went to print, ink had congealed I'm guessing on print head to badly to print.  Not a terrible thing if you have 2 backup cartridges...right?  Which thanks to cartridge supply system, I did.  Popped 2 new catriges in printer....they too were dried up.  no catridges near expiry yet...just brand new, full, inoperative 4 cartridges.  I thought of HP products as for proffessionals up to this but now ...not so much.  Quality in product has slipped and due to not being able to print unless online (thats just wrong) when a large portion of my printing is done offline.  Not happy with that at all.  Just a poor choice on my behalf.  Wont make that mistake again.  I will get a printer that I can easily connect to with wire in case of no wifi, fillable tank not worrying about cartridges or inability to print offline.  So stupid.  Service end was excellent, as they sent a new replacement printer within a week after 1 hr plus of trying to get printer going and 20 sheets of wasted partly printed test sheets.  My last 2 printers maybe 3 were all hp and I thought I would never change.  Last 2 I Owned over 30 years!
I could always count on them.  This is just junk, and bad business plan in my opinion.  Greed trying to hook people to company over wifi connection and control.  You are not my kind of professional at all.",Negative,373576876,Product Quality,Negative,Positive

I made the grave mistake of signing up for the auto-ink refills, that was a disaster... the account was always a mess, I had to go out and buy ink anyway because they never sent ink, but they billed me for number of copies I made, it was insane, then after discontiinuing that program, no amount of tech support can get the printer to communicate with home network anymore... without being connected to an auto-ink account, this printer is useless. I just want to be able to print things off my laptop, as I have been able to do for the past 25 years with all my other HP printers, but this seems no longer possible with HP.

"This copier does not work most of the time when called upon to make manual copies in the instructed manner -- usually after (sometimes long after) having made copies sent from the computer.  When opening the top/lid to insert the page, it clicks if opened all the way (90 degrees).  But no matter how much it is opened, and no matter whether I press the B & W or color copy button after (or before or before and after) closing the top, no copy is forthcoming.  Sometimes the button lights up but no copy count shows on screen, and no copy.  Unplugging/replugging. seems to be the onlyl way to make it work, and that takes a bunch of time while everything has to cycle up.",Negative,373832232,Others,Positive,Positive

I’ve frankly not used it all that much yet but my experience with HP overall has been good.  It was fairly easy to set up although there were some times where it wasn’t clear to me from the pictures just what was necessary to be done or I was afraid of breaking something.  Something as simple as taking the “covers” off the different color ink cartridges took longer than I felt it should have.  I’m not of the opinion that rotating the covers off is/was the best way.  I ended up using a small flathead screw driver to wiggle and pry the covers up and off.,Negative,374138715,Product Quality,Positive,Positive

I love the printer – when it works. I find it totally unacceptable that this is the third printer. I’ve had of this series. It appears it’s not the printer but the cartridges or perhaps it’s that the printer is not recognizing the cartridges. It’s very time-consuming to try and fix this and it seems to always happen when I need to print postage for mailing packages and I’m without a printer. It’s very very disappointing.,Negative,374313918,Others,Positive,Positive

I'm not happy about the customer service though. This has been non-existent and navigating your website to register my printer for the warranty was difficult.  One night a week ago around I finally found how I could email from your website but when clicking submit it would not send. Did you receive it?  I then sent a message on FB messenger and I have still not received a reply.  
I was wanting to check the serial number of my printer was correct as it is hard to see all the numbers.
I hope to hear from you after this.

I had to hire an engineer & pay him $60 to talk to hp support with me in my home. Finally, the female representative understood that the printer was defective.
You have NO IDEA what I went through, because I needed to print & scan important legal documents to my attorney.
I should sue you for adding to the physical pain I already lived with. The reps were useless; I blame the person who trained them. They weren't even aware that the black page that printed was all over the internet, with people having the same issue.

I was anxious, stressed, in MORE physical pain. What more can I say.

I'd say to HP CEO'S to use a call center in South America.

I don't EVER want to call you again. I've used HP since 1997. But now, I have to switch because of the unbearable interactions with the useless support team.

One representative had taken over my camera & never had me watch, so I can verify he exited my  phone's camera. I felt like I was being watched, all because of a very unprofessional support from that guy. He just kept saying, "" uhm, uhm, over & over."" 

Please HP leave this team & use a different support center; one that will train their team properly & keep track of all the issues the people on Google have issues with; they may learn something & keep up with the latest issue.

"First of all, paying the full price for half service is ridiculous. This is a printer; it should print documents or at least make copies of them. At this point it is an over-sized paperweight. The whole ""instant Ink"" program is nothing more than a racket and a gimmick. If you guys are going to ask your customers to pay this high of a monthly fee for ink and printing (much much higher than what the printer, ink and paper would normally cost) You should at least offer customer service that could constitute for charging that high of a price.

Second of all, there should be no struggling to understand one another when someone calls for help. Having only foreign ""help"" makes things more difficult than they already are. I believe the guys name was Rohit, he seemed to be more interested in speaking to his ""coworkers"" in his native tongue rather than solving the printer issues I was having. He asked me multiple times to take out the cartridges and flip them to each and every side over and over and over and wipe them with a piece of paper, which I did...each and every time, and when I did, I was able to hear him mute the phone and each time (yes, there were multiple times) he came back on the line, he was laughing and would repeat the last thing he said before he muted the phone. He had to have access to my phone and my computer, not one or the other, but both. After THREE HOURS back and fourth between the phone AND computer, no progress was made with the printer, I asked for a reference number to pick the call up later because we were obviously getting nowhere and my phone was about to die and he cut me off and said ""no no no only 20 minute more only twenty minute more"" to which I replied ""look, we've been on the phone for 3 hours and nothing has changed, my phone is dying now and I need to go."" To which he responded by placing me on hold again and speaking Hindi or Gujarati or whatever language he naturally speaks to someone around him and laughing, I only know this to be the case because he accidentally unmuted his conversation to where I could actually hear him this time which only solidified what my thoughts were earlier; There is no progress due to the fact that he would rather engage in a more entertaining conversation elsewhere instead of doing his job.

After THREE HOURS back and fourth between the phone AND computer, no progress was made with the printer, I asked for a reference number to pick the call up later because we were obviously getting nowhere and my phone was about to die and he cut me off and said ""no no no only 20 minute more only twenty minute more"" to which I replied ""look, we've been on the phone for 3 hours and nothing has changed, my phone is dying now and I need to go."" To which he responded by placing me on hold again and speaking Hindi or Gujarati or whatever language he naturally speaks to someone around him and laughing, I only know this to be the case because he accidentally unmuted his conversation to where I could actually hear him this time which only solidified what my thoughts were earlier; There is no progress due to the fact that he would rather engage in a more entertaining conversation elsewhere instead of doing his job. Everyone has days, I understand that, but this was ridiculous. THREE HOURS with no progress is absolutely unacceptable.",Negative,375231834,Customer Service,Positive,Positive

"The printer is great value for the money: duplex printing, scanning and copying, all in a small form factor.  The only snags are: 
1. It will only work with HP cartridges.  Even if an off-brand works today, it may not work tomorrow.
2. There is an incessant push to sign up for the cartridge replacement service.  I have already tried this on a different HP printer and did not find it useful.  A cartridge could run out as a result of a large print job and the mailed replacement does not arrive for a day or two.  Can’t really stock up.  Also, if you cancel the service the cartridges you already have will not work.  Really.
3. Stand-alone cartridges are quite expensive and don’t deliver a lot of pages.  I’m using this as a travel printer so I likely won’t be printing large runs.  But still.  I understand that the cartridge capacity is necessarily small to accommodate the printer size.  But still.

That said, it is a nice little printer.  Not quite as portable as I thought.  I used to have a Canon BJC-85 that weighed around 3 lbs whereas this is around 12 lbs.  Way different functionality.  But still",Negative,375304590,Price,Negative,Negative

"The subscription is a SCAM. And I wish I never bought this printer, let alone from this fraudulent company. 

They can clearly see how much ink I've used and printing I'm doing. Thus why I canceled 3-4 months after the free trial subscription because although I've signed up for the cheapest plan, $3.06 as suggested by HP instaInk. I'm was still paying from 6-10$ a month. Not receiving ink or paper, because the printer can detect the printer is barely being used.

Instead of being able to keep the ink I was given and the ink i had to request for, i have to return the ink and then go buy new ink.

 What?! Why?! I paid for it! Do the math.  Am I getting a refund.  No. Then why would I send back ink I paid for in the subscription.  

HP is treating people as tho they are incompetent. 

Keep in mind the printer came with ink. After 2 months I had to request the ink and paper i was supposed to received automatically.

The printer came with a 3 month free Subscription. Then in order to continue using the printer I needed an HP account which keeps u subscribed to their BS.
Had I known I would have never. 

it's a scam! I wish I never bought this printer. Waste of energy and effort. Nothing convenient about this .. 

The amount I spent just having a subscription I could have just bought regular ink at Target for 69.59. Or just find a local library/office print shop and spend the $2 per page.",Negative,375412635,Others,Negative,Negative

"I bought a new HP printer in August 2023, my previous one having lasted precisely 13 months before it developed a fault and had to be scrapped.  I only went for another HP because I had a few cartridges which would otherwise be useless.  This new printer (hardly used) started to print blank pages a couple of weeks ago, so I changed the cartridge (£42 for a pair) - but problem continued.  I then went through the entire problem-solving ritual on the app, again with no joy - the final message said to contact HP for service.  After battling for ages with the app I finally found a page regarding warranty - and it said mine had expired in 2022!  But I didn't even buy it till Aug 2023!  I also registered it straight away in the app, which I assumed would activate the guarantee.  I couldn't find the receipt to prove the purchase date so I scanned my bank statement to at least show the transaction (to WH Smith) and attached that to the dispute form.  I also wrote what had happened in the comment box, pressed send, and... got a 'sorry page not available, try again later' message!!

"I’ve needed a new printer for awhile now. Was getting tired of having to turn it Off, then On to get it to connect to my Wifi Network, which happened every morning when I printed out the daily crossword puzzle. Inconvenient, you bet. 
The old printer (4500 Series) was going to need ink soon. Both black and color. 
Seen an Ad about HP Printer sale the week before and decided to upgrade. 
Bought the OfficeJet 8015e for $99 + Enviro $3 + GST of 5%. Why there is a tax on the Enviro fee, I don’t know, no one has an answer for that. 
The cost of the printer was just a few dollars more than the cost of 2 new ink cartridges for the old printer. 
Bought the HP+ which gave me 6 months of ink and an extra year of warranty. 
Quality of print is excellent. 
The feature that helped me choose this printer is the self-healing network.  No more getting out of my chair to cycle the printer Off/On, but I still need to get out of my chair to get the printed page. But at least the page has been printed by the time I get to the printer. 
Installation:  Have your HP account set up before starting. Follow the instructions provided to setup the printer (remove packaging and installing ink. Plugging it in turns it on. 
Use the HP Smart App to do the rest. Didn’t have a single issue with the install and setup. 
Remember to “stay on target.”

"There are several reasons I will never buy HP again, even though HP was once a quality brand:

1) Blocking printing:  if one cartridge is empty or having technical issues, I am blocked from printing.  This is ridiculous and extremely annoying.

2) Restricting ink to printer ID:  I have ink from a previous HP printer, exactly the same model, that I purchased and can't use.  What a waste and I now have to wait for ink again, and find other locations to print.

I have truly enjoyed the 8028 that I had and have now purchased an 8028E model. I did this because my last one simply stopped accepting the ink cartridges. I had several cartridges on hand so rather than go to another printer I simply got the same but newer series. Frankly the features are great and the quality of print excellent. But I really wish the last one would've lasted a little longer than the 2 years or so that I had it. I don't have a business and just use it for use at home. My comment to make it a 10 would be better durability.,Positive,376143807,Others,Positive,Positive

"This is the print cartridge that is used by my printer, so no option to purchase something else. I do not like remanufactured cartridges, so I always buy the HP brand. I have had the printer for over 8 years and have gone through lots of these. They have increased in price over the years. I print a lot of photos and color flyers for organizations I belong to and for holiday cards. Last year, I printed about 60 holiday cards and used an entire cartridge doing it.
