That agent was really nice and helped me get the printer set up, but now I have THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HP+/INSTANT INK & PRICES FOR EACH ONE, AS WELL AS CONFLICTING WARRANTY LENGTH. When the agent set this up,  he said I would have 2 years warranty instead of one. Yet, on my dashboard on your website, it says I have 11 months and 17 days remaining. I set the printer up on Mar 26, 2024. I should have 23 months and 17 days remaining. In addition, the paperwork that came with my printer said that I could enroll in HP +/Instant Ink for 100 pages@$5.99/mo. I chose 100 pages on the app, although it said it was for $4.99/mo but now it says I have 50 pages for $4.99/mo. The paper enrollment I chose was $1.99/mo. In one place on your website it says I have printed 152 pages of 700. I don't think that's correct. In another place on your website, in my account, it says I'm not even enrolled in HP+/Instant Ink. In the email you sent me today, it states I've printed 82 pages in this billing cycle. Regardless, I signed up for the 100 page, NOT the 50. And which price IS it? And why does my account say I'm not even enrolled in this ink/paper program, while another place on your website says I AM? Furthermore, I can't even get the HP Smart app to WORK on my computer - I can't use my smartphone because it's too old and I don't have enough memory to even download it on the phone. When I try to pull it up on my computer, it's just a blank white page and I can't even close out of it. I literally have to restart my entire computer to get rid of it from my task tray and shut it down. I requested someone to call me - it was supposed to be around 10 minutes - and that was over 30 minutes ago. So no, at this point, I'm not too happy of a camper. I like the printer, although it sucks ink up like a sponge, but I can't say I'm happy with HP itself, since you seem to be all over the place in what you're saying I'm supposed to be buying for a specific price.

And you have to decide that before you ever use the printer, use HP+ or its features, etc. It feels forced. If you were confident in your products, you'd allow people time to come to an informed decision, either by being able to add HP+ at any time down the line, or by allowing folks to cancel without any permanent penalty. If you decide later you don't like HP+, you basically have to buy a new printer, which is total BS.

(2) Information was inconsistent. Is the Instant Ink free trial 3 months or 6 months? Found references to both numbers in both the printed information that came with the printer, the information displayed during setup, and the confirmation emails (e.g. after setting up Instant Ink for 3 months, the ""welcome to HP+"" email said I'd get 6 months -- and even later in this very survey it says 6 months!). Same thing with the prices of Instant Ink, which were one number in the materials, but then a higher number when you actually go to set it up. These were obviously changes that were made at some point that have not been updated everywhere. This doesn't inspire confidence in your attention to detail, and makes an impression that you're just trying to make as much money as possible off the ink and monthly services, with the printer itself feeling like an afterthought.

It arrived the following Monday. I began to set it up on Tuesday 3/19/24 and it did not work. I got print system errors telling me that the ink cartridges were leaking and to check them and if leaking contact HP and if not reinstall and restart. They were not leaking so I went with that option. Still the error occurred. After an hour of trying on my own, I contacted HP support. They tried to help and had me do everything they could think of to solve the problem and then had me open a BRAND NEW pack of ink and go that route, still did not work. So now I have opened and wasted 2 packages of ink. They tell me they believe it is a faulty print head and that they will be issuing me a new one. Ok, fine. However they did not mention that they old one needed to be sent back, it was not a big deal but just an irritation that I now needed to go to FedEx at the end of a long day. It took a week for the print head to get here. I had to reach out and tell them that our shipping department closes at 2:30 and since it was Friday we are not open on the weekend it will need to now wait until Monday to be delivered, so now we are looking at 3/25/24. 11 days after the original printer was ordered. A week after the original printer was received. The print head was not the solution, I installed it and used the set up ink that came with it and it did not work. I reached out to support and after an hour and a half of chat and videos they decided they would replace the printer. So I ask what the procedure is. They need a $1 collateral in case we don't send it back, ok fine. ""When will it be here"" they tell me by April 10. April 10th?!?!? That is not ok. I tell them that is not ok it needs to be here sooner, they tell me they can get it here by the end of the week for $25 more. I tell them ""no that will not work. Do not process this. I want to speak with a supervisor"". I never heard from one. I called the next day 3/26/24, at this point I am very upset. The printer was faulty out of the box through no fault of ours and we would have to pay more to get it here sooner? that is not right, that should have been on HP. Had the printer worked like it should have I would have had a working printer 3/18/24, but if I didn't want to pay additional money I had to wait over 3 weeks to get a working printer? In what world is that right when the customer did nothing wrong? In the end HP came to their senses and did not charge us the extra shipping and did ship overnight. Then came the FedEx issue. We are a manufacturing warehouse, so our hours are earlier than most and our shipping and receiving dock closes at 2:30 pm. I got the notification that it was going to be delivered by 10:40 am, i thought ""no problem"" then I got "" its delayed and will be there by 8pm"" well obviously that does not work. I called HP and they told me to call FedEx. The first day it was fine since it wasn't on a truck yet. The 2nd day however, it was on a truck and they could not do anything since HP does not allow FedEx to change anything. So I called HP back and they would not help me. Once the new one came, there was no set up ink that came with it, well it requires new, unused ink. so I had to open my last thing of ink. Overall, I spent over 5 hours on support with agents, I called HP at least 4 times, FedEx at least 3 times, emailed HP 3 times, and have opened all the ink I bought as spare ink. I have used HPs my entire life, in fact when researching printers for our business I made the decision for this printer because of the brand and I am feeling highly disappointed. I now have to spend at least another $130 to get more spare ink.",0,0,1,0,0

Palo Alto, CA 94301-1112

Dear Hewlett Packard (HP) Complaints Representative,

I am contacting you because I am thoroughly disgusted with the amount of problems I have encountered with HP since leaving Dell Computers and Printers.

Recently while attempting to switch printers from my ENVY 6400 series to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 for my home-office, I was told something that was very disturbing for me. I was told in an email HP Instant Ink that they could not cancel my subscription until after the next billing cycle on April 29, 2024, nor could I return the unused (still in shipping package), for my ENVY 6400 series even though they are still in the packet they were received in. 

Because of my age (87 years old) and in that category that has never been trained how to do certain things on a computer, I subscribe to the HP Smart Friend at a monthly cost of $16.99 per month. For the most part, that is working out for me, however, when I am transferred to two or three departments for the same thing, that does not bode well for me, and mainly they are asking me to perform the same procedures the person I was transferred from had me do. I was told that I could return my tempted cartridges for recycling, or donate the unopened and unused cartridges to charity in more than 60 countries. Territories and regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North and South America through the HP Planet Partners program. What an insult!

I have so many case numbers that I cannot count them, however, the latest one is: 5122040597 and it was only to install my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 Series printer, cancel the Instant Ink Cartridges, and transfer my subscription to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015. I am trying to remember how long and how many transfers I had to go through to make that transition. And to add insult to injury, I received an email welcoming me to HP’s Paper Add-on Service 1. I have never ordered paper nor do I plan to order paper, I will continue purchasing where I have purchased for over forty years.

Corporations like HP and greedy stockholders are doing everything within their power to drive America into bankruptcy at a high rate of speed, by contracting everything to individuals or companies outside of the Continental United States of America.

I enjoy my printer but the hiccups relating to ink cartridges and their cost, instruction manuals and troubleshooting issues are so clouded and confusing because of the bajillion model numbers and various models when it comes to honing in on an issue. I had an issue with my HP printer connecting to my phone and mobile devices in order to print from remote locations for my job. When that feature worked well I loved my printer. When my printer wasn't available or there were issues with ink levels and other minor operational hiccups, I was livid. But that is true for any computer product from any company these days.

After unsuccessfully (following HP Smart) getting the printer driver - I simply could not find it to connect wirelessly - I bought a cable to connect directly.  That also did not work.  I called a tech support organization which I have to pay for - since HP doesn't have one for installations - to get the printer to work wirelessly. It took them over an hour to figure out how to get the printer driver downloaded and work the printer wirelessly and they followed many of the same HP Smart steps I did.
The next day, the printer did not work wirelessly even after restarting multiple times.  I reconnected the cable, and the direct connection worked.   
The next day the HP Smart program popped up again, so I installed the printer driver again and took advantage of the HP ink program.  I lived to regret that the next day when the printer stopped working again.  I have now connected it directly again. 
Any money saved by buying this printer or using ink through HP which requires the wireless connectivity is offset by the lost time, productivity, and cost of making a simple connection to the computer.

HP Ink:

 I recently cancelled my instant ink and these are the cartridges with remaining ink. 

I used ‘instant ink’  because it was offered with a promotion on a purchase of a new printer. 

When I realized I wasn’t using the amount of ink that would make it worth my while I decided to cancel. 

It was the end of the trial and when I called it was a holiday, Good Friday, March 29, 2024.  I didn’t realize I would have to return the cartridges and that my printer would no longer work until I replaced them with store bought cartridges until I went to print the paper work from the cancellation. No stores open on Good Friday.

The agent could have made that more clear really.

I did get new cartridges the next day so no big deal really. 

In the beginning they sent me one set of cartridges and I was to replace the ones in the machine that had come with it.  They weren’t barely used but you had sent me new cartridges so  I sent them in the recyclable return envelope provided. I thought that was the deal. I guess I could have kept them as they came with the machine. Then I would have been able to use the printer after cancelling instant ink. 

So I was shocked that you wanted the ‘instant ink’ back as I had only used 1/4 of them by the end of the free period. The only set of cartridges I received for the whole free period time.. I thought that was pretty poor for you to take them back not completely used but on thinking about it further they are coded to be able to see when I need ink so I kind of understand now about that. Still I was very surprised that you would need them back. 

In conclusion I have been pretty satisfied with the printer HP OfficeJet 8015e. Sometimes it tell me to “check for errors”.  Still not sure what that means. The support technician said I should unplug it and plug it into an unprotected (non surge protected)  outlet.  I tried that I still get the error.  It is printing ok just not sure what that means and I didn’t get an error code. If it persists I will call tech support again.

I have had many printers from Hp and some very expensive ones when I was in business. I am retired now for 17 years. I am now on a fixed income. I hope you won’t be charging me for cancelling one day after the monthly period. I had not used the printer at all after that monthly time period. The agent at “instant ink” ( when cancelling) said I wouldn’t be but in that email attached #3 says I will get a final bill. I don’t think this is fair. Can you please correct this?

Why not send the replacement as soon as we install the new ink cartridges?  Why wait?  Then when we have to print multiple pages for a project, we are out of ink.
- the paper feed many times pulls in multiple pages.  Therefore, I am wasting ink and paper because we need to reprint.  Very frustrating!!!  
- Ink cartridges are hard to open - when turning the cap to open it before installing into the printer.  An older person, someone with disabilities, or myself would really have a difficult time. Many times I have to use something to give me leverage to take off the orange cap. 
-  Ink cartridges have leaked numerous times when first opened.  Stains on carpets, clothes, etc.  I know I love at a higher altitude, but I wold of thought you would have tested this before going to market with this product.
- Ink cartridges have leaked when I have had them in the supplied envelope for recycling.  Leaked onto my passenger seat in my car as I was driving to the post office to drop it off.

Even then, the connection wasn't perfect. But earlier this month when the connection failed, the HP tech with whom I connected did a fabulous job solving the issue and improving the printer's overall performance. For that alone I'd give HP a score of 9 out of 10.
But, I'm unsure about what I've signed on for with HP Ink. I've received printer cartridges at the appropriate times. But the I find the issue of printing paper confounding. I recently received a box of several reams of HP paper even thought I'm nowhere close to using up the reams in the original box. And I'm unsure about how you determine the number of sheets of papers I've used. After I had ordered HP paper, I was still using the remainder of what I had in hand. Did HP charge me for that? Can the company provide a simple outline of how the paper provision system works? If I had an indication of just what my monthly payment is buying I'd give HP a higher grade.

When she would some time to respond, I did not rush her response time at all. At the end, she even disconnected the chat due to her impatience. She was not even capable of answers all of my questions and by the time she disconnected, I still had more questions. 

I still do’t understand the whole purpose of HP+. From my understanding, I have to pay in order to use the ink. If I don’t pay for the ink that the printer already came with, then HP will have my account suspended. What’s the point of having the ink come with the printer if you still have to pay to use the printer after? 

In order for this new printer to be used, I was charged for prior balances on my account that I didn’t even know I had. I was never made aware of any prior balances until I got this new printer. I still don’t even know what the prior balances were for because it is not stated anywhere. How it is even possible to have prior balances? In order for there to be a prior balance, that means that I was supposed to pay for a service or product. Assuming that I did in fact receive a service or product, how did HP allow that without me paying? It doesn’t make any sense to me.

When I was charged for whatever prior balance was there, apparently I wasn’t even charged the full amount at one time. Which again, doesn’t make any sense to me. HP was not transparent about the amount of money that was supposed to be paid. I was charged for one prior balance amount one day, then the next day I was charged for the other prior balance. By the way, Elize said that I would have to re-enter my card information for my card to be charged again. That makes absolutely no sense. 

I was supposed to receive Instant Ink for 6 months for free according to HP. According to Elize once the second balance was paid, she could give me a credit that would offset the payment for this month. If I am supposed to have Instant Ink for 6 months free, why would I need to pay for this month? Under my HP account, it says that I won’t be charged for Instant Ink until September.

We were pushed into buying a printed for my husband. The salesman lied by saying,  these were the inkind replacements for the two hp printed that stopped working. They were not.
We ended up with a very complicated monstrosity that prints 2000 sheets a month. My husband is lucky to use 100 sheets a month and 2 faxes a year. This was clearly someone that wanted a commission so bad that he lied to a long standing customer of instant ink. 
 
The so called manager also lied when he said, “ We wish that we could make you happy.” 

I suggested they reimburse us for the difference in the printed that truly was the one that replaced his old printer. It  should have been  in the 8000 series. He kept trying to give me free ink or an extra warantee. Useless crumbs. 

We are on the HP ink program so basically he offered worthless solutions.

He tried several things but nothing would work. He spoke to his supervisor and the suggestion he came back with was for me to send  this printer back and they would send another one. That would mean I was going to be sending the broke printer back as well as the new replacement printer.  That was not acceptable.  I needed a printer and I had waited for about a week for the replacement printer.  I did not want to hear that I had to wait 7 days to two weeks for another printer.  He went and spoke with his supervisor and returned with a method of overriding the preprogrammed printer.  To my pleasant surprise it worked.  The representative named Aamir refused to give up.  His heart was in helping me the customer with the printing problem that was created by the people responsible for shipping a replacement printer to me without the specially programmed ink cartridges. We spent a lot of time on this issue and I was exhausted after we finished but I was happy that I was lucky enough to get Aamir who was determined to help me get this printer started. He got 6 stars from me.

The second representative did a great job as well because the next day the printer wouldn’t print.  He too was very thorough. He found the problem and took off the baggage  electronically that was preventing the printer from printing.  Both men were examples of excellence from your company!!!!!

381656777,"I have had HP printers for years and my biggest issue has been related to the HP Instant ink subscription service.  I typically buy a much higher end printer than needed to get some of the additional features, but printing usage it very low, under 100 pages a month typically so a printer rated for 2000 pages a month should last me forever. But the issue is once in a while with past printers I would get locked out because of the instant ink subscription and it typically would require support to get it back online.  Not only does this take a couple of hours or more when this happens, once the printer is more than 2- or 3-years old. support wants to push toward upgrading the printer, which really irritates the hell out of me, since my printer has only printed 2000 pages in that time when it is rated for that per month.  
The last time this happened in November 2023 I decided it was time to upgrade and went with an Epson product after visiting with the manager at the local Office Depot store and explaining my frustration.  The Epson worked fine for 5 months, but last week it did an update and the new driver actually looks the only print from devices on 2.4 Ghz WiFi, this is true even if the printer is connected via CAT5, it simply will not print if my pc is connected to the same subnet on 5 Ghz WiFi. I spoke to support and the tech said that is the way it is designed to work.  And to test it I connected it via CAT5 with my laptop on the 5G WiFi and i would get an error every time. If I switched to the 2.4G WlFi the document would print and error clear.  So back to Office Depot it went under the Satisfaction Guarantee clause. And I am back to the HP with instant ink and hopeful the connection issues are resolved, and I do not have that issue going forward.

Even ink-free processes such as scanning are disabled if anyone does not meet HP's new mandatory ink & paper level, which must be completely full at all times. Due to their unethical, illegal business practices, I've been forced to file a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. The BBB had spoke with HP, and HP's 1st agent I spoke with admitted that I was not supposed to receive the illegal firmware update because I bought my printer before this illegal practice, price gouging, and other offences were quietly snuck into HP's victim's peripheral via unauthorized firmware update.

Historical problems and not resolved despite numerous calls to tech support:
I owned a HP Officejet Pro 8620 for seven years and love it! In 2022, while printing, it asked for the yellow cartridge to be changed. I did this, then, it wanted the cyan cartridge changed. I changed it. Then, “Printer failure. There is a problem with the printer or ink system. Turn printer off, then on. If problem persists, contact HP.”
I turned the printer off/on. Didn’t help. Replace the new cartridges with another set of new cartridges, removed and re-inserted all of the cartridges. Still getting the same error message. Went on-line to tech support and through the diagnostic question process, with, what seemed like a robot. The result was, sorry, we cannot find a solution to your problem.
Checked listed service centers. Staples. Called Staples. They do not fix printers and could only send them back to the factory but only if still on warranty. The printer is 7 years old…not on warranty.
Asked about similar printers in stock and they had an HP Officejet Pro 9025. Went and bought it.
Set it up, went on line to complete the installation, (not an intuitive process by the way). I tested printing, copying and scanning with a word document. It would print and copy but not scan. Need to download some other driver. (The box says print, copy, scan and fax. It should do all of this ‘out of the box’ with just ONE download!)
Went on line again. Found the software. But would not let me download it unless I:
-	Opened an account
-	Signed up for something called HP Smart
-	Signed up for the ink
Did all that (under protest!!)
Driver started to install. Got “stuck” and then message that it could not find the device! What?!
Went into my test word document to check out printing ….. HP 9025 no longer listed in the print window! What?!
Opened control panel and checked list of printers. HP 9025 listed but “no driver installed”! What?!
Noticed another printer listed “HP Smart”. Huh?
Went back to the word document and found HP Smart listed as a printer. Selected it and (yet another) window asking me to confirm printing to the HP 9025. It is the only printer I have connected…it has to ask? Printed OK.
Wondered if the scanning would now work, so selected scan from the printer and yes, it scanned the document and sent it to my computer. However, unlike the 8620, it did not give me an opportunity to select the output format. Opened the scanned document on my computer. JPEG. Hit the drop-down file format menu. TIFF, PNG, no PDF!
So how do I scan as PDF?
All of the above occurred shortly after buying the 9025 in 2022. Since then I have had numerous problems, mostly with scanning, but also with ""off-line"", or ""printer can't be found"" messages. I have made numerous calls to tech support (check my file). For some reason I now have TWO HP 9025s coming up on the list of available printers. One of them says ""copy"" and it is the only one that works. My experience with your tech support people has not been good either. They seem to bumble around, not knowing really how to fix a problem, just shooting in the dark till something sort-of works.
The scanning problem is persistent. When I scan to computer, three devices are listed. One does not provide the PDF option. The second does provide the PDF option, but when I scan I get a message on my computer ""printer not found"", which doesn't make any sense at all since it is the printer sending the message. The third device doesn't work at all. I figured out a work-around for the persistent scanning problem. I scan to a USB as a PDF then manually transfer the scan to my computer.

I bought a code from Amazon for $5.Now explain to me how $5 equals free! 
3. So the Amazon code worked. Got the printer all set up. And the first 45 pages you print it out perfectly I'll straight up when you look at the app to preview and put it out exactly like that. Then the next page I printed printed upside down and backwards. I wanted it to print in the top right hand corner of the page. But instead it printed in the bottom left hand corner of the page where I already had something printed so that ruined both of those projects. and I have very limited paper! In between a bright pretty page and down and backwards pretty page I had not touched any buttons on my phone or on my printer there was nothing touched to change to position of the page printing!

The first tech that I talked to on the night of April 20th was extremely helpful polite and willing to put in whatever time it took to try and fix the problem up to the point to where I was getting too sleepy to keep going! So he set up for a phone call the following date. Well the tech who called me had none of those attributes! He's been very little time trying to assist me and did very little to try and find out what the problem was he kept telling me that the free 3 months trial was automatic with the printer and I did not need to have a code which was wrong because it wouldn't go to the next page without me you putting in a code And then he kept telling me that the upside down printing issue was a problem with the Samsung phone and that I needed to contact Samsung and tell them that it was their issue to deal with it because it was he said it wasn't a printer issue !! I had counted on HP! My dad bought HP printer laptop He's gone now and I still have his HP laptop All of his office electronics were HP so seeing that I assumed it was a quality company! I thought I could count on them to stand behind on what they sold! But I guess you really get what you pay for.

382507837,"Honestly I think the HP Plus program is criminal, not the ink refill program I think that's great The HP +. Why do I think that? 
 It's because my printer was working fine yesterday while working from home, I'm on a hybrid schedule and work 3 days a week from home, I needed to print multiple documents and a couple of them printed satisfactorily.  As I tried to print one from my phone I used HP Smart, it asked for my PIN number for my printer it's a  HP Office jet pro 8030 I believe. I just purchased at Costco less then 8 months ago. First time I ran out of ink I found some HP ink cartridges at local store and reinstalled them.  They worked fine.  I ran out a second time the HP cartridge run available at my local store so bought some ink off Amazon, wasn't the cheapest I could find, it seemed to be high quality ink, five-star reviews, put it in carts...I received a message that they weren't genuine HP, and I accepted it.  Printer worked fine for days.  Jump to yesterday printed a document worked okay then I need to print one for my phone and here's where the trouble began.  I installed the HP smart app trying to print from my phone and ask me to I put in pin #.... I found the PIN number in the printer and hit okay, then a message abouton the HP + pops up I got ok and now my printer is bricked. I was on the phone for 3 hours yesterday trying to unsubscribe from HP + so I could print important documents for work!  The gentleman created a case number 512-301-3147. I was unable to print important work documents and water hrs of my Friday evening!  As you can imagine it was extremely frustrating.  Though it says if you're not happy with HP Plus you can pause or cancel anytime apparently you cannot. 
Again 3 hours discussing this to me that's criminal acts as my Printer somehow got immediately flashed and now would not print for my phone or my PC.  The min I hit ok on HP+ it flashed my printer to no longer accept the cartridges that were in there and working fine.  I told the employee to cancel it I asked him to ward my avoid my warranty that I didn't care I just needed to print a document I was transferred to another gentleman nobody would cancel my HP Plus membership I asked if I could delete my HP account and create a new one and reboot my printer he was of zero help there essentially told me there's no way it's impossible to cancel which I don't believe to be the case due to the verbiage in the agreement and the fact that it's a method of HP locking customers to use their ink, which again I actually prefer HP ink and would have bought it didn't have it available at the store You can understand how frustrating this is.  Eventually I put in the empty old HP carts. 
 The resulting printed documents looked horrible but it was my only choice again after 3 hours of conversation. I've had five HP laptops, HP desktops.  My current JP Envy 360 convertible I thought was a great computer aside from it's unbalanced weight, my previous DV6 again thought was a great computer, My last HP printer worked great, but I tell you 100%, that at this point I'll never buy an HP product again. Now, apparently my case hasn't reached full resolution after our 3-hour conversation and resetting the printer three times I still couldn't get it to print anything again and the high quality aftermarket carts had ben working fine.  I completely understand you want everyone to buy your ink and it could void the warranty, but it was a $200 printer I would happily buy another one getting these documents printed was much more important in 3 hours of my time worth much more than $200.  
After digging through your pages and during this 3-hour conversation I found a statement that there's no added cost to sign up for HP Plus. You just need to own supported HP printer and use genuine HP ink or toner. Plus if you decide you aren't delighted with HP Plus, you can change, pause, or cancel it at any time at no cost."". Well apparently my computer printer has been flashed with some type of software that your employees are unable to remove and I now have a paperweight until I can find some HP ink which at this point I refuse to do. I even asked a gentleman just to send me a few ink cartridges overnight so I could print them the following morning and regrettably he would not do so I guess we'll see where my case goes but my current plan is when I have my garage sale in May to sell all my HP products and head back to Costco to purchase new printer new laptop new desktop etc. Not even sure if you guys read these things but that's my story",0,0,1,0,0

382660318,"In general, I have been very happy with my prior HP printer (OfficeJet 8600 series) It was a workhorse for 10 years or so. The printhead finally died and rather than replace it (it doesn’t like my 5G wifi - I don’t think that existed when it was new), I got a new HP 9125e which seems to be the closest replacement for the features I need. I note that it is much less robust (fine, saving weight and plastic - although the paper tray is definitely flimsy and does not seem to securely hold 8.5 x 11” paper). I’m trying the Instant Ink free 3 month trial but so far the experience is not great. I know that ink is the profit center for printers and they are sold at or near cost to create demand for ink. HP is getting pretty heavy handed here and that is a bit disturbing: 1. You are blocking competing ink suppliers by chipping the cartridges and further obligating new Instant Ink customers to promise to NEVER use other ink suppliers AND telling us that is we cancel the subscription, you will incapacitate the cartridges - talk about big brother! 2. I set my new printer to turn off at night to save power and be a tiny bit greener. HP said it couldn’t communicate with my printer and sent an email telling me to never turn off the printer or disconnect it from the internet. This again sounds very invasive and anti-conservation. There is no need to monitor my device constantly. Having it check in once a day sounds like it would be plenty.

382727769,"The wireless setup should be an easier process, it should take minutes rather than hours.  My printer connected to a wireless card on my desktop over Bluetooth due to the  proximity of my desktop.  Luckily I have an IT back ground in desktop support so connecting laptops/PCs to printers was just a matter of troubleshooting the issue after 2 hours, I was getting a little frustrated, but having patience is part of my job. 

A friend of mine however, had a similar issue with one of your new HP inkjet wireless printers, which she purchased this year, she was so frustrated when she asked me to help, she was going to return the print device.  After 2 hours, I finally, had to download software from the HP support website and connect a USB cable from her printer to her laptop.  Only after this, we were able to have the laptop communicate with the printer.   So first thing you need to do is fix the wireless issue.  You will lose sales if you don't.  Better instructions should be included especially what possible cables may be needed, to complete setup.  I know you asked about my printer but there are older people that don't necessarily have an IT background and they will return the equipment rather than trying to understand an offshore technician over the phone.    

My printer once I got it connected works well, whether I use my phone, tablet, desktop, and laptop. It uses hardly any ink for even the most color graphic print outs.  Very economical, if someone tells me they are considering buying another printer and they're even thinking about an inkjet, I tell them to consider a tank printer.  My last printer was an HP Officejet that lasted for 7 years.  I originally paid $100 for it brand new out of the box.  The after costs in buying ink cartridges, probably brought my ""$100"" to a ""$1,100"" printer.   

The tank printer is a little more expensive, up front cost but I was willing to pay as much as $275 for a printer.  I know I would have already paid $120 in ink if I had purchased the inkjet.  My tank printer has just recently got to the point were, I can see the level of ink in the ink display windows.  I figure I will need in maybe late Dec 2025 or early Feb 2026.",0,0,1,0,0

I have often asked NBN and Telstra to check the internet connection and my modem.

I have had long chats on the help line with Telstra who confirm no dropouts.

Most end up with the cartridges not working well either.Done with HP.Update 4/18/24:I ordered what I was hoping was a reconditioned set of cartridges from another Amazon vendor. It came today, and it worked! Now just hoping that it doesn't change one day as well, lol. But glad that it works for now.

 Next time I buy a printer, it will not be HP.  My first HP printer lasted for 5 years. We used it during the pandemic and it endured heavy usage due to increased usage as two of my children attended school from home during that time.

Hi Dusan,

I have found the case number from Tech support in January which is 5119517831 and whoever your colleague was i spoke too from instant ink in January, to told me that he had put a note on to add an additional three months onto the nine months free giving me a total of 12months for the inconvenience.

As i explained to him at the time, i replaced the instant cartridge with a new one and my printer had an error saying cartridge jam or words to that effect and when i spoke to tech support they told me the printer had failed and was broken so i purchased the new printer but just before i was about to set up the new printer i tried the faulty one and found it had started working again so when i called technical support again he apologised for telling me the old printer was faulty so giving me the extra 3 months, although i wasn't very happy about it as i had just purchased a new printer for over £180.00 when i didn't have too and i tried to send it back to the company where i purchased it but they would not accept it back due to me opening the box.

Hope this helps and gets resolved.

Regards

I have spent approx. 2 days of my time trying to get the printer to connect with my laptop.

On top of all of that, the printer still does not work! On Friday morning I was told to return it to the supplier & that I would get an email to give to them explaining why. As no email had arrived I contacted the Support centre again - only to be told not to do this, but to wait as the issue had been escalated.

384907089,"When I bought us a new HP printer back in late 2022 or early '23, I had no idea at the time the whole thing was going to turn into what for my wife and I essentially has been a huge, stress-inducing nightmare! Here's the deal: We're retired and I'm now disabled and basically no longer able to get around, so just getting over to and/or moving our printer around at all (my wife has to help me with that kind of thing) is a major undertaking. Still, when the print quality started going downhill late last year, my wife let me know about it and I knew it was about time to order more ink cartridges.Not being an emergency, we weren't in any big hurry, but days or maybe even weeks later, it was time to make the effort to get over to our home office area and take care of it. My wife grabbed my crutches and gave them to me so I could get up and over to my walker, then I made my way over to our little home office area, seated myself, fired up the PC, got online and set out to replace the failing ink cartridges. Hmm, it had been a little while since I'd used the thing myself, so I didn't remember what model it was, so I reached over and used the little touchscreen controls on the front to check the settings, which told me it was a Hewlett Packard 8020. Great! I got back on the desktop, logged in to and shopped around online until finally deciding I liked one third-party set (with an overwhelming majority of good (mostly five star) ratings at Amazon.com) and went ahead and ordered them, which was a little less expensive than HP cartridges. As usual, they arrived quickly and without incident in just a day or two, but the printer still printed, so we set them aside until the ink we still had left totally ran out. It really got very little use: my wife and I both were career programmers, so for us, computers were just another tool, and we didn't really use our desktop for entertainment at all, unless maybe the TV zonked out, so it was awhile before replacement proved absolutely necessary. No problem (ha!). Anyway, when I finally decided to install the replacements, which proved to be pretty difficult for me, we were both totally shocked when the printer wouldn't even fully start up, telling me on the touch-screen it would not use the cartridges because they weren't HP (which we knew already!). What the heck? I rechecked everything, online and off, but I couldn't figure it out (at first), other than no matter what I tried, the printer refused to even try using them (although it DID recognize they were all full)! They just wouldn't work, so finally I admitted defeat and tried to go through the Amazon refund process. Nope, that's not happening either! By now it had been more than 30 days since I placed the order and no refund was possible. The reason for that was stupidly simple: we didn't waited until the accursed device wouldn't print at all before ordering more, and it turned out to be longer than expected before we had to! So, after receipt, naturally we waited until we had to change them (my wife and I can't afford to waste money), but that put us outside the Amazon 30-day window to ask for a refund we didn't even know about... What a mess! Okay, so now what? Obviously, we needed still more ink cartridges, which made me angry about having wasted our money on the first replacements, so I got back online and logged in at Amazon again. Time for another huge shock: while double checking everything to make sure I would get something that WOULD work, now I discovered that the ratings for these cartridges had changed for the worse, to the extent that even though more than 50% were still five star reviews, now about 44% were ONE star reviews, all of which stated it was because the printer refused to try using them! This sure smells like a scam to me -- somebody is making a lot of money, and it sure isn't us! Was it HP, because the printer wants ONLY HP cartridges now, or was it the third-party sellers, selling products that wouldn't work but couldn't be returned? Now I really was mad; I always check rating percentages before ordering anything, and at the time of this order, most were glowing five star reviews. Now though, a couple of months later, almost half were one star reviews! What the heck happened!?!?Oh well, basically it didn't matter now. So, with nothing else to be done, I decided to just admit and accept defeat, calm down, and figure out how to order something that WILL work. Instead of relying on what I'd found in my printer settings, this time I went back to our original order detail and discovered the printer was NOT an 8020 model, but an 8025e model, which was NOT supported by the cartridges I'd ordered! Well, now I knew, but why did the printer software tell me it was a 8020? After using a search engine to examine some online photos of HP printers, my wife came over and disconnected everything so she could move the printer around enough to discover the name and model number printed on the lower right side of the front panel, which we couldn't see from the desk. Yep: 8025e. Wow... Why did the onboard software (and what showed up in the desktop PC printer queue or softwareOkay, time to wrap this up before I blow a gasket. After CONSIDERABLE research, I finally ordered what I believed to be exactly what we needed, making sure all of it really was made by Hewlett Packard (one large black cartridge and three standard, smaller color cartridges cost nearly ONE HUNDRED BUCKS, when the stuff I'd ordered before had been under fifty (!!!), and obviously at that time WORKED for the majority of users, most of whom crowed about the money they'd saved!!! ARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!). Hold up now -- deep breath -- get a grip, dude... ;-) Well, we'll know by tomorrow night.

After a couple of months, it went ""offline"" and I don't want to tell you how long it took me to find out how to bring it back ""online"" so it could actually be found by the system and used to print.  I think I eventually had to reinstall all the software.  HP scan was always problematic, although now it can scan using Microsoft's scan interface.  This printer also goes through some noisy and relatively long setup process before actually printing; this description is vague because I have no idea what's going on and the printer doesn't provide any messages.  And its ink cartridges have very VERY bizarre packaging--I actually had to call HP to find out how to open the packaging and install the cartridges, because it seemed like the logical way to do it would either damage the cartridge or break the printer.

That said, once all the problems were resolved, ir has been a good machine.  It does a good job printing, it's quick, it offers good options for printing and copying--I really like the copy resizing function--and has had no issues for the last two years.  I have a smaller HP multi-function OfficeJet installed on my laptop and have had no problems at all with it.  We have had printers from other manufacturers in the past and always come back to HP because HP printers are, in our opinion, the best on the market.

I still have not been able to talk to a person. 
I did reach a representative of Instant Ink who explained that process and connected me to Lucas from HP who assured me that all printers should come with a power cord and Ink to get started. But he was not able to send me the missing items. He would only be able to replace damaged items. He said I needed to deal with the store it came from. 
Today is the 3rd day I am trying to resolve the issues. I would prefer to receive the missing power cord and ink cartridges, but if that is not possible without driving one hour into Anchorage to go in person then I would like to return it and be refunded all my money or sent a new one directly from HP.

But it has been overall positive. I have barely used the new printer. Installation was fairly simple but I found it very difficult to install the print cartridges from the side. The printer is on a low table and I had to squat very low to see to install the cartridges. I bought this printer online and never would have bought it had I know the installation was so different from my HP 6950 and every other printer I have ever had. I'd still recommend HP, but not this printer for anyone my age for who low squats are not comfortable.",0,0,1,0,0
385562651,Not nearly as easy to set up as Epson or Cannon.  Seems to me like HP lost their way in the printer space.  I am told that only genuine HP cartridges will work.  Scanner software is strange.  Thinking about returning for another brand.,0,0,1,0,0

385605980,"It took three weeks to set up this printer.  It printer instructions make certain assumptions that may not be true in every case.  In the case of this printer, HP assumed that a wireless set up was possible.  However, my printer is located in my office in the kitchen, and the router is at least 35 or 40 feet away in an upstairs closet.  It is not possible to move either one.

My old printer was hardwired to my old computer via ethernet.  Your online instructions suggest that this is a possibility for HP Officejet8015e, so I went to Best Buy to buy an ethernet cable and a converter--$50.  I brought them home, only to find that this particular printer doesn't have an ethernet port.

Because I could find no further instructions from HP (and because I am really not a fan of ""chats""), I made an appointment with Best Buy Geek Squad (more money), loaded up my printer, cables, laptop, etc. and went to the store.  They found the necessary cable for hardwire to be a simple USB (only $8.00).  Because your instructions at Hp.123.com insist that I need to download drivers, I asked them to do that for me in store.  Surprise!  The hardwire connection doesn't require the drivers--even the Geek Squad tech didn't know that!

I set up the whole thing at home, and asked to SCAN a document to my computer.  More surprises.  The hardwire allows only printing.  To use any other function on the printer, I had more hoops to jump through.  

CONCLUSION:  While I can now use all the functions I need, this setup was unnecessarily frustrating because of inadequate instructions on your part due to your beginning with unfounded assumptions about every homeowner's router/printer proximity.  This is a simple fix on your part, but until it IS fixed, I would not recommend this particular printer.

A second unrelated assumption on your part is that people working on laptop computers will be willing to sit at a desk hardwired to their printers so that you can gather information about how much ink they use and when to send more.  This is just unrealistic.  I don't know about you, but I work outside on a pretty day and in my easy chair on a bleak one.",0,0,1,0,0

388517861,"I just opened a box of black 962xl HP copier ink April 25, 2024. I bought it in January. When I opened 1 corner of the box to remove the Ink, it was leaking everywhere. I had it stored in a lock & lock box that is air proof & water proof. There was a small piece of black plastic MISSING off of the cartridge I noticed after Inspecting it. I installed the cartridge anyway to see if it would work, after I patted the outer cartridge dry from leaking black ink. The copier refused it saying it was a ""Supply Issue"". Printer said to install a different black cartridge. I didn't have another one. I removed broken one & reinstalled it, but the printer refused it again. This was obviously a manufacturers defect. It has been over 3 months so I knew I wouldn't get any refund. I threw away $51+ in trash. Thankfully Amazon can deliver next day. I do appreciate the fact that Amazon sells the ink I need. I wish HP would restart their recycling program for their ink cartridges. It breaks my heart to throw empties in regular garbage that goes to the dump. I'll never ""stock up"" again though with HP inks",0,0,1,0,0
