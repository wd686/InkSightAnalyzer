I am still getting this massage which will then not allow me to print or scan documents until I open the document feeder and the scanning bed before printing.  There is no paper in the ADF during these occasions.  During initial setup, It also said that the print cartridge carriage was jammed and unable to move.  While talking to HP tech support I noticed that the gray top on the print cartridge carriage was loose.  I opened the carriage top and successfully snapped the cover down while waiting for another solution from the tech rep.  It solved the carriage problem. The gray cover had apparently been left unfastened during factory assembly and was not covered in any of the setup instructions. The ADF issue is still a problem with this printer."

It was complicated to install but I did it and it worked for about a week.  After a week I it went off line.  After that I ;could not maintain the wifi connection for more than one printing session.  I was constantly updating - removing the software, updating, and reconnecting.  I think HP has made something simple that worked complicated with the goal of ultimately selling more ink.  No thanks. Six months of ""free"" ink does not deliver without the complcated and disfunctional connection.  Not worth the hassle.  This one goes to the dump and will be replaced with a corded tried and true printer.

It never printed the same again,  even when I replaced the new cartridges you sent out to replace the flawed ones.  I guess I was expecting the same quality from this new printer as well. It just doesn't cut it. I definitely would not recommend this printer to anyone.  The sales person at Best Buy assured me that this printer was just as good if not better than my original one. I strongly disagree!"

Bad design; as it takes very little for these cartridges to pop back out.  I figured I was doing it wrong.  I started looking for assistance and there was no method to get assistance in a timely fashion.

I called yesterday and was told the ink had been dispatched last week. They couldn't help more and told me to be patient.....
I checked on the Royal Mail website yesterday and it said that they had not received anything yet.....

I just bought this new printer which was fucking horrible to set up because your fucking phone robots won't allow me to speak with anyone and then everyone I talked to wanted to pass the buck to someone else. What a shitty and horrible entity HP has become.

I pulled my old printer off of Instant ink but it doesn't come off right away, no, it takes time and your company decided to overcharge for the removal. What pure fucking scum.

Also, the page plans you offer are bullshit. There's a big unnecessary jump between plans.

I have come to hate HP as much as Comcast. What a bunch of pure fucking scumbags.

It could easily be so different. You obviously need a change in management.

It kept erroring out right away after trying to connect via the app by saying the network was unavailable (or something similar). I tried multiple different ways, ensured the password was correct, multiple times re-entering the password, etc. I had to about 6 times ""reset"" the wireless functionality before it finally worked and was accepted.

The installation process was very straightforward, including the tanl filling.

I was looking for a more eco friendly and cost effective home printer. The large ink tanks and refillable bottles certainly cover the first requirement. I look forward to some genuine savings when they need refilling.

The print speed and quality are excellent for a home office printer.

So far, I am very pleased with my HP Ecotank purchase. If it produces anywhere near 6000 pages and the refills are reasonably priced, I suspect the days of the cartridge printer are behind us."

I like the savings of ink and based on the number of copies I print.  I had been on the 500 a month plan because of the amount I was printing for work.  But with a change in my work, I print fewer copies a month, so very helpful to change the monthly p,an.  Nice to know that if my needs change I can increase the copies per month.

I was told to go to hp support, which was a pain in the you know what, because Microsoft no longer supported assistance.  I had to entering in the serial number repeatedly.  Talking to bots, was ridiculous.  I have used HP since I was employed with them back in 1981.  I would never recommend this piece of crap.  The ink that came with the printer lasted a whole 20 pages which was spent printing out the same thing, alignment issues.  It wouldn't scan, then it would, then it wouldn't.  I was and am so frustrated.  I rarely print anything anymore.  I got this to print out things for my grandson who is 8.  I was told I'd get free ink for 6 months.  Hell, I didn't get it to work for over 4 months and now you are charging me for ink.  When I only got 1 shipment from your company, and I was told you are charging me $1.00 a page to print.

Also, I subscribe to HP ink, but instead of being treated better by HP for my loyalty, I get messages that tell me they’ll stop my print capabilities if I don’t keep my printer plugged in all the time. I have recently moved and don’t have a permanent place for my printer yet, so it only gets plugged in when I need it. I’m still paying for HP ink every single month, which is over priced and I don’t use enough to make it worth my while, so since I’m still paying for it every month regardless, I don’t feel that I should be threatened with taking away my print capabilities.

Recently, I replaced the color cartridges so that I could print parts of a banner, but the color failed miserably.  I have mostly printed out in ""black-only"" mode.  Also, the printer goes through long maintenance cycles sometimes justt after I turn it on and before anything is printed.  Sometimes it cycles after printing.  What is it doing?

368087210,Others,negative,0.4542838931083679,"This is quite literally the worst printer and service and customer service I’ve ever had. Terrible interface. In a year I’ve printed maybe 12 pages. The ink provided didn’t last long, and nowhere does your software say I have to sign up for a subscription ink plan. So I buy ink and it doesn’t work because I’m supposedly signed up for some subscription. So I finally determine that I should use the plan I didn’t sign up for and then the ink sent to me didn’t work. Tech support took hours. Turn it off again, on again, clean out the paper jam that wasn’t there, clean the ink cartridges, blah blah blah. 

Then it thought there was a paper jam when there wasn’t. But couldn’t clear the error so it was unusable for months. Again a long call to tech support. Hours of my time to fix a paper jam that didn’t exist. 

And then the ink runs out. Subscription service fails for multiple reasons… can’t locate the printer, new credit card can’t be found, old credit card expired. Tried to close the account altogether and it got stuck in internet land for a year. Couldn’t open a new one because the old one wouldn’t close. 

Tried to buy ink outside of subscription but that’s not allowed. New ink I spent $$ on doesn’t work… because I have a subscription that I can’t access because it’s stuck in cancel purgatory. It won’t cancel and yet I can’t access the account. And I can’t sign up for a new account because I already have an account. Printer dead in the water for another few months. Who has time for this? 

Customer service doesn’t care. Says I can sell it on Facebook marketplace if I don’t like it. Nothing else can be done."

Almost immediately my printer malfunctioned and won't print.

Chronic paper jams, difficulties communicating with my husband’s yacht design program and most recently, cartridge issues that were so frustrating we abandoned the printer and went out and bought an Epson.  The HP Smart Print website is extremely annoying.  I couldn’t get a replacement for what turned out to be a defective cartridge without spending over $55 to buy one and when I tried to buy one, the site tried to force me into a subscription (I already subscribed to HP Instant Ink) for ink AND paper. It would not let me simply click on the cart and checkout.

368098287,Others,negative,0.9370983839035034,I dislike the fact that I can't use what is left in the ink cartridges if I cancel my subscription. I should be able to use what ink is left and just not get any new cartridges sent to me. As everyone's knows the cost of everything has gone up so paying a subscription for ink was one of my first things to be cut to save costs. I however homeschool and still needed to print but being able to buy ink as needed was the situation I found myself in because every dollar counts when feeding a family. I have most of an ink cartridge left that is just useless to me now because I couldn't afford the auto shipments. If I was able to use the ink until that was done I would absolutely love and recommend this printer to everyone but since I can't I have actually told people not to buy it.
368098444,Others,negative,0.7047905921936035,"The printer works great. The problem is the ink cartridges, they only last 50 pages and they are empty. A full set of ink cartridges is $120.00, that is about $2.50 per page. Nobody can afford that. My old printer which used cartridge #02 would last about 300 pages. I can't get #02 cartridges anymore, so I had to throw away a perfectly good printer. So I would NOT recommend an HP printer to anyone. Fix the cartridge problem, or I am going to throw my 8025e away. Because I can't afford the ink consumption to print with it. What ever you do, DON'T APOLOGIZE to me. Because apologizing means that HP is not going to fix the ink cartridge problem."

I would like to print 20 some pages of recipes I only end up printing maybe five or six and then it stops I was told by friends that HP printers are junk, but I bought it because it was cheap and I needed it, I would never ever purchase another HP printer because I see what everybody was telling me it’s junk they don’t print well they get to a certain status and then they stop and that’s not good when you’re trying to print out documents and the documents of 15,20 pages or more it was a waste of my time and money.

After the six months free trial I was still using the original ink so I decided to cancel the subscription. The original ink ran out after about 8 months so I put in the cartridges I had received after 2 weeks. A message came up saying because I had cancelled the monthly subscription, I could not use the cartridge. I had to buy some which I am still using. The printer is okay but will not link up up to my computer, only the laptop. I had a Kodak printer for years and it was far superior to the HP."

I have also signed up for the auto replacement program and would like you to ship a new set of cartridges immediately.
368133057,Others,positive,0.4472171664237976,"I installed this printer because my old (formerly reliable HP) was acting crazy. It was time for a new one. The 4100 worked fine for a day or so, then has been constantly becoming ""disconnected"" no matter what I do. No other devices in the house are disconnecting from the Internet or from my MacBook Pro. I tried powering down the router several times and occasionally it'll come to life. But why in the world would anyone have to traipse all the way downstairs to cycle power on their router/bluetooth  device? It's insane. I am putting off calling for help because I'm so frustrated, I have to calm down!

Also, I really hate the tiny operator control panel. It's so dark, I can barely read it! Why doesn't it light up more? And the icons are so non-intuitive. Why can't we have words on it like the past models? My old one was a 5200 I think. In that series anyway. 

I love that it's light. The IQ is good. And even though the cartridges are harder to put in (so tucked into the mainframe that it's a little awkward), I managed to do that okay. 

If anyone wants to call to set up an appointment to help me, I'd be happy to oblige. 

Thank you,

Customer : Printer has been landfilled. Time: 4:16 PM
HP Agent : I see. What we can do is to cancel the subscription and I would like you to read the terms of cancelling: Time: 4:19 PM
HP Agent : Please be advised once we cancel your account:

1. Since Instant Ink is a postpaid plan, Cancellation requests take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will receive one final monthly charge.
2. Instant Ink cartridges will no longer work after this final month of service ends, and you will need to buy retail cartridges and replace Instant Ink cartridges to continue printing.
3. Rollover pages and free month will be lost. Time: 4:19 PM
Customer : My customer service experience with this process has been less than stellar to say the least. I couldn't buy the printer online, I had to call, once I called the service person took way too long to resolve the issue of shipping & billing addresses being different when paying with a credit card. Now this is way too complicated to just remove a printer from the plan. I feel like HP was not the best choice in this purchase. Time: 4:20 PM
HP Agent : I understand you Todd and I apologize for the inconvenience. With removing the printer in account, I will be glad to assist you with that if you wish to cancel now. Time: 4:22 PM
Customer : Yes I know that the instant ink plan is a post paid plan. The printer is GONE. I HAVE A NEW PRINTER ENROLLED IN THE PLAN. WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT? I have already enrolled the new printer in the plan. Time: 4:23 PM
HP Agent : I can check what I can further do for you, Todd. I don't intend to make this hard for you. I just want you to know the terms for cancelling the printer. I hope you understand. Time: 4:24 PM
Customer : I have like 12 windows open across the top of my screen for something that should be able to do myself from my Instant Ink account page. It's like $8.00 a month for the plan. I've wasted 10X that dealing with this. How is it that this is the Best HP can do? This process is horrible. Time: 4:26 PM
HP Agent : I realize where you are coming from, and we wanted this to be convenient for you as well. We could have just enrolled your printer as a replacement with your old printer to automatically cancel the old one. Since you enrolled, then I will assist you on cancelling the old printer that is already dead. Time: 4:30 PM
HP Agent : I can request the cancellation on my end and will ask for your phone number and last 4 digits of your card to cancel and see what we can do about the final bill. How's that sound? Time: 4:31 PM
Customer : I've wasted enough time with this. Delete the old printer [8610] from the account and leave the new printer [8025e] enrolled. HP has enough information to adjust the account for the next billing cycle. Time: 4:32 PM

Customer : 3366 Time: 4:32 PM
Customer : It was not at all clear from the documentation that you are not to enroll the new printer you are to replace the existing printer. Time: 4:34 PM
HP Agent : I will be glad to assist on cancelling the old printer and you don't have to worry; I will be requesting the cancellation for you. Please allow me to check what we can do further. Time: 4:34 PM
Customer : HP can send me my ink cartridges since only trial ones are included with the printer. Time: 4:36 PM
HP Agent : The 2 options are choices, for enrollment a new printer. The option to replace the existing printer will transfer the subscription of the old printer to the new one. In case it will help in the future. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : Also, automatic ink shipment for new printer has been processed upon enrollment as well. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : Success
The account has been canceled successfully Time: 4:37 PM
Customer : Thank you. Can we finish up? I've been on here for 40 minutes now. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : That is for your old printer. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : The subscription for your old printer is now on the progress of cancellation and will be effective on March 18 - the end of this billing cycle. Time: 4:39 PM
Customer : Perfect. And the new printer is enrolled? Time: 4:41 PM
HP Agent : Yes, It is enrolled. Staying in the program will send you free ink, we will automatically send you ink replenishments once your printer notifies our system that you’re already low on ink. You will also be able to save up to 50% being with the program rather than buying cartridges in the store that might cost you up to $30-80. No worries as your new printer will also receive a shipment when needed. Time: 4:42 PM
Customer : I know. That's why I put up with this terrible system. Time: 4:43 PM
Customer : Does HP have a program where I can rent the printer? Time: 4:44 PM
HP Agent : I can check on that. Does it like, you will rent a new printer from HP. Am I correct? Time: 4:45 PM
Customer : Yeah, so I don't have to buy a printer or ink. Just paper and HP looks after the rest. A service like cable TV. Broken printer no problem HP will send me a new one. Time: 4:47 PM
Customer : Now that would be worth like $10/month forever. Time: 4:47 PM
Customer : Are we done? This has been painful, like a root canal with out anesthesia. Time: 4:48 PM
HP Agent : Thank you for confirming. Please give me 2-3 minutes to check about that. Thank you. Time: 4:49 PM
HP Agent : I just wanted to know if we are still connected. Are you still there? Time: 4:52 PM
Customer : Yes. Time: 4:52 PM
HP Agent : Thank you for waiting. For the meantime, we currently don't have that kind plan. That was a great idea I guess and maybe we'll come up with this kind one day. Time: 4:53 PM
Customer : K. I'm done. Thank you you are great but the process over which you have no control really sucks. Save this chat and take it to the next Customer feedback meeting. Thank you. Goodbye. Time: 4:55 PM"

Needed to download and reinstall drivers on multiple occasions.

Plus I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with insta ink experts who were unable to resolve this issue and to say say it was frustrating is a understatement considering when I first called I wanted and was transferred to tech support who instantly transferred me to insta ink support without hearing my situation and then after 2 hours and no resolved issue they gave me a case number and said they would send it to the tech support and I was to call tech support for help with was who I asked for in the 1st place.

It doesn't, so paper is wasted. The printer is  used in a home office scenario, so double sided would have been appreciated. Sales staff need to be trained properly in what features items have. Also, when reading the information on the HP website, it comes across that the printer does do double sided ADF. Can't comment on the ink use yet, as it is too soon, but copies are clear and quick."

I have known HP printers for many years and find their quality to be the best, but the ink is quite expensive. I put “9” and not “10” because I would like to be able to purchase cheaper ink, refilled at 25%, 50% and 75% of the full volume, because not everyone prints “with heavy duty” and the ink can dry out and not be used..."

Its been a year but  problem that sticks out most is lack of instructions and possible do's and don'ts and better trouble shoting. The biggest problem I had was Printer wouldn't connect to my internet and after 2 to 3 days of internet searching I figured out why. My internet was not password protected. I live in remote area no neighbors so I had it open, once I put a password on it connected. Would have been nice to know that in the instructions.  The app was a bit clichy at first and to figure things out, just had to play with it, use it, trial & error I guess you'd say.  Probably some of my problems had to do with my internet, its not the greatest, slow & up & down sometimes.  As far as the printer itself, Im pleased with it, the cost of it was reasonable and have had no mechanical issues so far, and learning to like the app and some of the useful things on it.  I am using the ink program, so far I like that. The last time I was sent ink was not sent a return envelope for the empty cartridge.  Overall I'm pleased with the printer."

It took ages access, but I eventually spoke to someone from your team who was extremely helpful. He took control of my printer and got me up and running.
I only use a printer for very necessary airline and other travel and accommodation documents. 
The ink situation I am told needs constant wifi connection. As I go away for 5 months each UK winter, it is simply a waste of time and money for me. I turn off all electricity supplies at the mains, being away for so long.

It was very confusing and very difficult for an elderly person to understand so I gave up in complete frustration.  Even the ink that was sent to me was too big for its slot and didn't  fit. Why can't companies like yours make a simple printer that can print from a phone and be very easily and simply set up for elderly people who are not tech savvy?

I am really disappointed regarding how quickly the ink finishes especially since it appears to be a printer that can be used in an office. The ink is also extremely expensive and there is a point where you can’t use the color nor black ink without both sets having sufficient ink left in the cartridges. The ink cartridges for a printer of that size should last longer or be much cheaper

I only used I think 2 free cartridges of each color of ink during the entire 6 month trial. I wasn’t aware that that would be the case and I was surprised to find that out at the end.

Now, I know that I've got to get on a chat for someone at HP to help me, but I just don't want to...I don't have time to devote an hour or more to print one page that I need. I think it's a problem that I feel that way about your company, don't you? I pay money to you every month to use a printer that I bought and knowing that whenever I stop paying you that monthly fee, I can't use the printer...even though I bought that ink. I paid you for it.

The printer itself works fine. I believe it's our third printer in recent years. So, we consider ourselves loyal clients.

The main issue we have is with the ink. The cartridges are ridiculously expensive. But tired of receiving blocked messages for using alternative ink, we recently subscribed to your Instant Ink program. 

What a disapointment that has been. We ordered the suggested initial order and HP can't even get that right! The order was placed directly on-line through your app and 10 days later, still no sign of the order or evidence that the product has even been shipped. 

How frustrating. We tried to encourage HP and it's a total flop. I understand it's difficult to match the Amazon next day service but 10 days and still no information available. Really? Customer service didn't have any answers today. Polite, yes, but doesnt help us replenish our empty ink cartridge. And let me tell you, B&W print outs for work / client purposes, not too impressive.

We are not complainers but I received the survey email and since you asked, here's our feedback. 2/10 simply because the idea of Instant Ink is convenient. But overall, as an experience, what a failure. 

We will evaluate our options over the next day or two, then make a decision on our subscription.

Please and thank you,
Andre

One is at my condo in Palm Springs and the other at my condo in Los Angeles. Both locations have WiFi service. I use my iPhone to connect with both printers to make copies and at times to scan and send documents.
When the printers aren’t working a message will show up on my phone that either the printer is busy (which it isn’t) or cannot be located (although I registered both). I’ve tried disconnecting and then reconnecting the power to the printers, making sure that the ink level is full, that the paper in the drawer is adequately stocked. Sometimes the printers will then work, but currently each one is now unresponsive to commands to print documents.
I also find that there is no adequate customer support when I call in for assistance, and that if I reach a live person I’ve been told I’d need to pay for upgraded customer assistance.

When I inserted cartridge it spilled blue ink into machine. Cleaned area as much as possible reported the damage cartridge and requested a replacement. Replacement was never received. So I purchased new cartridges to try to remedy problem myself. During initial setup printer would not recognize new cartridge and would not allow initial setup. Therefore a brand new printer could not be used, initiated or function at all. This printer was purchased for my winter home retreat so when I tried to reinitiate printer with new cartridges it was too late to return or replace printer at the store where it was purchased. Will never recommend HP due to lack of customer service and assistance. This is also why I canceled my printer subscription as well. Thank you for your interest."

I am 70 years old, and on a fixed income. I called HP and told them my needs for a printer, could they recommend one. The lady on the phone said get the 8034e. So i looked it up and Amazon while we were talking. It was selling it for 150.00, HP was selling it for 250.00.
I asked the lady why should I buy this printer from you for 100 dollars more than Amazon is selling it for? She said she would give me free instant ink for the life of the printer.
I agreed to buy it. 6 months later i receive a bill for 7.00 for instant ink. I have gone thought several of your team members, all of them say they will exoculate the problem.
Then I don't hear from anyone. So all I am asking for is my 100.00 dollars back that I was cheated out of. If i do not receive it buy April 12,2024, I will have my sister video tape me smashing the printer with a sledge hammer. I will put this on every social media net there is. I will let everyone know what happen to me and the ethics of HP.

The replacement lasted a bit longer, however when the print quality again fell to terrible levels and paper jams occured more often than not when printing and having followed instructions and replaced print-heads, cleaned printer etc. there was no difference.   So I threw out the expensive spare Ink bottles I had, put the printer in the bin and bought an Epsom.  Will never buy HP again."

I didn't give the experience a 10 because (1) HP makes it overly difficult to migrate from a prior Instant Ink-enabled printer to a new one and (2) HP Instant Ink packaging for the shipped replacement cartridges is terrible (insufficient protection allowing cartridges with broken locking tabs to arrive, necessitating a trip to Office Depot and out-of-pocket cost for the needed cartridge).  Also, the HP Smart software doesn't give sufficient flexibility (e.g., always pushes in the UI to assign a password, which is rarely needed by a consumer with a secure wired/wireless network at home).  I was one of HP's Enterprise Architects, and I do not appreciate HP pushing unneeded firmware settings onto me."

I then discovered the free trial and didn’t unbox or install the purchased cartridge and signed up for the free trial.  Like most home users, I don’t use my printer a great deal so with the free ink trial, I got one refill of black ink. Compound this with the fact that the black cartridge that comes with it is minimally filled and you’ll get some idea of the quantity I print. Right after the trial ended I needed to print again and was out of black ink. I installed the purchased cartridge and it will NOT print black at all. I’ve been through all the troubleshooting steps in the app and the HP website and all point to to replacing the cartridge. Unfortunately, because it’s been so long since my Staples purchase, returning it isn’t available. So I’ve lost that $30 and need to reconcile either spending another $30 on the chance that the cartridge is bad or chalk it up and purchase a new printer.

First, I just happened to notice that in one day it charged me for 18 copies - however - we were not at home that day!!  The rep I spoke with suggested the power went out and back on and that's why we were charged.  I lost all my confidence in the program that day and cancelled.  then when I went to use the computer found out that it only works with store bought cartridges.  So the cartridges that I had became INVALID.  Just did NOT have a good feeling about HP anymore; especially after being loyal and staying with HP printers and laptops."

We wanted to go with an ink tank printer for the cost savings because you all started pricing your cartridges beyond our price range. We did a lot of research between HP and Epson and wanted to give the new HP Smart Tank first try as we like HP printers in the past.  Your website description was not very clear so we talked with the sales person and they could not find out for sure if any of the HP Smart Tank printers would do 2 sided copying and 2 sided scanning which was a must for us. We all decided to give it a try since it did 2 sided copying it may do the others and meet our needs. We get it home, hook and set it up and give it a try. It prints great but will not do the 2 sided scanning and copying and we couldn't find one of the new ink well HPs that would so it is going back as we have purchased an Epson with the ink wells that will do what we wanted. Very disappointed that we could not find an HP that met our needs. Maybe you all can catch up in the future and next time we need a printer we will again consider HP!!!!"

That is the first printer to have to do that.  Not only is that stupid, it also means HP has access to everything we print, when we print and how much.  YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!    So with that, NEVER an HP product again.  2.  The deceptive INK program.  My wife cancelled at the 6 months then found out the printer won't work until she buys more ink, had she know that she would have used the printer to use up the last cartridges of ink.  So now they are worthless and full of ink.  STUPID.   So we will be selling the Printer to someone else and let them deal with HP the Information THEIVES!

This one has given me trouble in hooking up the wireless WiFi.  It ran out of ink within 2 months of buying and I had to buy more cartridges. I had barely used it.  Now, the printer doesn’t print every time and shows Message that says my computer is not hooked up to my printer.  I’ve had to have my son and son in law come fix it and hook it up to WiFi again.

But there are too many people who have complained that the ink kits clog up their printers, and in some cases, wrecks the device itself. It would be great if HP sold the kits to fill them. Inside the cartridges there is a sponge that absorbs the ink and releases it to the printer head. It just seems like a waste of money to replace the cartridges every time you run out of ink. It would be great if HP made them so that you could refill them. I do recycle the cartridges. I send the spent cartridges back to HP. But I believe too many people throw them in the trash and they wind up in the landfill, which is sad."

I have paid a lot of money for HP cartridges in the store because the HP cartridges that I was suppose to be receiving were too late for me to use in my classes at the university.  For example, I couldn't print the syllabus that I needed to get to 28 students.  I could only print half of them on the small ink cartridge.  The next day I went to the store and bought a large HP ink cartridge for $46 and then kept getting messages that I shouldn't be using them on the computer.  The ink was never on time and never enough when I needed it.  I have not received an ink cartridge for 5 months. Now that my initial 6 months is over, I am told that I will pay every month whether I get a cartridge or not.  Something is wrong with this system.  It is not helpful to the customers.

The main frustration about HP: I do NOT like the automatic charging of my credit card! Emailing HP has not stopped this practice. I am unable to speak to anyone about what is needed. It seems I am charged for paper I have NEVER received!!!  This company has taken advantage of using the customer's charge card!! Also, printer ink is sent when it is not needed.  FOUR black print cartridges have collected that have yet to be needed! Is there not a way for me to stop cartridges from being sent until they are needed? The color cartridges arrive as needed most of the time. I have considered notifying Visa to stop accepting charges from HP! I still need color cartridges occasionally.  Your clients should be able to order only when cartridges are needed and not be charged for what is not needed! Jackie mcgregor50rj@gmail.com    509-65-5361"

It would be great if someone would take note and correct the situation. THANK YOU

After talking with agent, they stated nothing they could do and out of warranty.  Purchased a replacement. I had unit on InstantInk so took it offline for 1-2 yrs. and then before deciding to toss and desiring to use ink I had purchased; connected and tried with success and has not printed extra.  Family uses as backup."

Updates were harder to get done and I could not print until they were done. Since I had so many issues with getting the ink I stopped the free ink. I am not using the printer because it is not worth it. It seems like the ink gets used up faster than it did before. HP was my number 1 printer to buy. Not anymore.

If I had more time I would have not bought the printer.  I had just started 4 online classes and my older HP went down.  I had a lot of printing to do and I paid for it. I had to pay your company 58.00 dollars for printing on my paper and buying my ink. Sorry if I don't want your instant ink program.  I only received 2 delivery's for HP. I didn't need color ink. So your company needs to unplug from my Printer. I plan on selling this one and buying another brand.

369109402,Customer Service,positive,0.5361612439155579,"My wifi had to be unplugged one time. Upon repowering, the printer refused to reconnect. It's the most temperamental printer I have ever owned. Don't even get me started on the Instant Ink program. The printer refused to work at all unless I was enrolled in Instant Ink. I never received even one ink cartridge from this program. The amount paid each month, it is far less expensive just buying ink elsewhere. It's a system that basically you continue to pay monthly for a printer you already own. The customer service is abysmal. The apps just take you around in circles.
I have since switched to another brand of printer, and I am pleased. Hopefully, I will never deal with HP again, unless many things change. Thank you."

My other issue is that the text placement on paper isn't always accurate. I did adjust the thingie in the printer to the paper size, but it often cuts of the things that were supposed to be on the bottom of the page and I have to waste paper and my monthly page limit to reprint. The ink prices are pretty high too which is a bit of a shame as well. Other than that the print quality seems to be great, unless I want to print a bigger image. In that case the printer comes up with some issues often stops printing and the image comes out with stripes."

So for months the printer sat. We purchased an Epson because the HP had no ink. Then it developed some issue and went offline. Last week I finally decided that we had spent money on it and we will use it. So we went and bought ink from Walmart, finally fixed the issue and will use it until it runs low again. We had 6 months or something of free ink and got 1 set of cartridges. Now I am getting billed the monthly charge. I will more than likely cancel that and just get ink locally when i need it."

Very frustrating!! Recently the printer wasn’t waking up and couldn’t be found on my iPad or iPhone. I had to switch it off and then on again.

369484428,Others,positive,0.6191065907478333,"This is an old printer that was sold as an up-to-date printer on Amazon. When I went to register it on the website, it was said to be out of date with no new software!!! I had just paid hundreds of dollars for it. When I was finally able to dig out of the website the appropriate software, it was very difficult to install. Connecting it to the network was very difficult and required at least three separate times turning off the router, turning off the printer, turning off the computer...My initial remarks on the Amazon website are most of the concerns. Installing My HP, all software required multiple installations to work properly. The only software that was an instant success was getting an email address for the computer. Getting the ink supply setup went easily until I had to actually subscribe to the service...this also required multiple attempts to finally succeed. Setup for the fax was again difficult with ""hidden"" features difficult to find. Setting up the computer to store faxes has not yet been possible. Even getting the all-in-one to receive a fax was difficult and I missed many faxes as a consequence. 

I have no problem whatsoever with the HP quality: print...type, pictures, all great. That is why I bought another in a long line of HP printers. My last was the Officejet Pro Plus 8600. It lasted over seven years and was wonderful until the last when it simply quit working. The new replacement for it was too expensive for me now."

I fed up with the many hours and time I spent with reps that won't help.  The last call was to a representative to tell them about the repeated offline printer and the charges for ink.  The only reason I purchased this printer was the incentive of 6 INK trial, which I never received, I was charged instead.  To date, another debit was charged to my charge card and never received the ink.  So, I was ripped off for the ink and for the useless PRINTER, WHICH IS CURRENTLY OFFLINE.

During the rime I was working I experienced great difficulty in the operation of my printer……it would not stay online between use and I was bombarded with emails telling to benefit from the ink delivery it needed to be permanently connected but nobody could tell me how to make it stay on line.  Then I was sent emails accusing me of using shop bought ink refills ….. and scorning me for doing so……I have never used any ink cartridge except the ones sent to me! My use is less now, however as retirees we still have a lot of paperwork to complete for our health care, pensions, questionnaires on everything we do and endless appointments for my husband, and my son who has MS.  I do not have time to set up the printer from scratch every time I need to print something but that was the only way it would work.  In desperation this useless office item was retired to the garage over the weekend and has been replaced by another well known make which is functioning superbly.


Your emails are no reply, I cannot find phone numbers…so the decision has been made.

Additionally, I sometimes may need to print more than other times and I worry that the ink will run out just because I printed extra paper in one or two months and then maybe no printing or very little printing for several months. It’s difficult to keep up and remember where I am. When I bought the printer the ink ran out after just a few uses. Also, I didn’t realize when I bought the printer that I could not print on both sides of each sheet. I guess I thought that was something that was available on all printers in this day and age and not something that would be considered an “extra”."

I liked the way it worked.It gave quick results and I was reasonably satisfied with it - until it started going offline at regular intervals for extended periods. In the end,I just got fed up with it, and on the advice of staff at Office Depot, I replaced it with the present Tank model. Although it's nice not to have buy cartridges at frequent intervals, I found it very difficult getting accustomed to it and it takes a very long time before it's in a position to do a copy job or a print job.After about a year, I'm finally getting used to the fact that when the printer still goes offline (for reasons I don't understand), I can, as an alternative, use HP Smart Printing. The printer also makes a lot of noise when it's getting ready to do a job (as if it's got indigestion or is being roused from a deep sleep!)"

Seemed like I had to ask every time I needed ink. Sometimes the cartridges didn’t work so then you are without ink for 10 days of your plan waiting for the ink to come. When it is working it’s a ten. Just too often no ink, ask for ink, wait 10 days. Don’t use all the rollover pages then & it’s not worth it then. We gave 2 houses so I was glad to see the pause option now. I usually paid the $1 to keep the 10 page plan on the printer we weren’t using that was at the other house."

After I have replaced the ink cartridges 2 times I have spent more on ink then I have on the printer.  All printer companies reduce the productive of printers to be less ecco so users have to spend tons of money on cartridges which is where printer companies make their money.

Also the printer you sent me was not usable upon receipt.  I spent hours on the phone with HP techs trying to fixing when they finally gave up and sent my a return shipping invoice to get the printer replaced.  The replacement printer I received was a lesser model and cheaper than what I paid for.  After multiple calls and emails that were not responded to I gave up.  HP used to be a trustworthy company.

I have to shut it off anon everetilme I print, instead going to the same page after a jam, it says printing for least 5 minutes then starts from the beginning, it determines how many pages it is going to print then its done, says no print jobs. For example if I set up a print job for 15 pages, the printer does 6 and stops. Also when that happens sometimes it decides to print the whole document 1 to 3 days later. The pull out tray sucks for holding legal size papers on it. I read in a blog you are aware of the situation but in so many words that meant deal with it. The feeder for scanning or copying is so small if you are scanning you have to make three saves vs 1 on my other printers I have had. You setting make ink disappear like water. And if I purchase other than you ink product the ink level indicator doesn't function. The Adobe system to set up to use for printing whether I use your ink or generic makes the ink last double than using your program.

HP pushes customers toward your ink program, and there are by default several processes running in background on my computer that check for updates, do a copy count, and wait for prints / scans.  What I STRONGLY prefer is software that's just a normal printer driver, and LEAVES ME ALONE.  I went to the trouble -- and it was NOT EASY -- to install a less-invasive HP driver that's termed something like ""limited-feature.""  I don't need a monitor, I don't need a nanny, and I am fine going to Amazon or Walmart to get a print cartridge when I need one.  ALSO, when I change paper to put in envelopes or legal size paper: the printer clicks, clacks, buzzes, clicks some more, thunk, thunk, clack and finally is ready to print.  I suspect it sucks in a little ink in the process but I'm not sure.  The main reason I chose this printer is that it does not force me to put in a color cartridge to print in black and white, like Epson does.  I am fully aware that the function of a printer is to sell HP (only) ink, but for me, I want printouts, envelopes, labels.  I don't want your ink program.  I don't want the printer to suddenly decide it wants new firmware.  I just want printouts and to be left alone.  Hey, you asked."

Again talked with customer service for nearly 2 hours, with the resolution of the problem was to replace the red ink. Did not help.

I used the cartridges a few times so they're practically brand new still, I wouldn't be mad if I was low on ink y'know but the fact that I only got to use it a few times really pissed me off to be frank.

I am legally blind, and was having trouble finding numbers that they were asking for on the back of the printer I have four other printers and I’ve never had as much problems that I’ve had with the HP printer. It’s been sitting on the floor for months because I can’t get myself to throw it away but I don’t wanna buy ink for it. I know it isn’t my Internet because I have a canon printer that connects every time or the HP printer just keeps telling me there’s a problem but not what it is. Most frustrating printer I’ve ever had in my life I would not recommend it to anyone finally got the software which I thought was appropriate for it but then they wanted to charge me for it. Assistance has not helped. I will read it lower than zero, but there isn’t any way to do that. I bought it for convenience because I need to have some thing in large print from my phone again because I am legally blind and the only way sometimes I can read things it’s a print them out in large print. I’ve spent many hours on the phone with your support team with no help. Obviously, they don’t understand that people have disabilities and can’t comply to read small print that they’re up."

Also the printer will not print because of 'paper mismatch', when the A4 paper is loaded, and takes a minute or two while I play around with the paper.
When I try to print photos, either 4x6 or 5x7 size, the picture does not fill the photo paper but leaves uneven edges. I have asked about this in my local Currys where I purchased the printer and they were unable to advise me.
I do not wish to join the HP scheme for receiving ink and linking with HQ so that my ink usage is registered. I buy ink online for a reasonable price when I need to refill.
It is the worst printer I have ever bought. Even though it was a reasonable price, I would not buy an HP printer again."

I don't feel your support is good at all.

I bought the new 8010 and was supposed to get 6 months free ink thru HP Smart.  Only gave with 2 months and then stated my billing would start next month. Don't even know to call for that!"

That one quit printing well, even though there was adequate ink in the printer. I searched online for a replacement and the top choice was the HP Officejet 8015e, which I bought from Amazon. When I unplugged the old one, there were three cords to take out. The owner's manual for the new one told me just to plug it into the power out and follow the instructions. I choose English and....voilà! Scan the QR into my phone, registered with HP that way, subscribed to ink supplies through HP+, and then went online with my PC and searched 123hp.com! Easy installation, it aligned itself, first test page looked great, and I am ready for many more years of easy and high quality printing for my home office! Thanks, HP!!"

You seem also to be expanding into the cloud information market, however that works. That must be the reason for the insistence on networking, WiFi, probably other sneaky little apps that tell you, about me. Cookies are the least of it.

The reference guide (closest thing I found to an owners manual in the package) is a joke. Could you at least have a site on your webpage (that address printed on the carton somewhere, not buried  in the whole corporate shebang website.

It's real nice you have the whole process automated for technological incompetents, like myself. It's nice. When it works. It's not so nice when it doesn't. 

I have been wrestling 4 days, on 2 computers getting this thing setup. I think I mostly have it, by stumbling around in the dark. You want to know why 5 out of 10? I think I am being generous.

A USB cord would have been real handy-and I know you are actively cautioning against using it. I don't even know if USB-A to USB-A patch cords are even available. but at least a note on the packaging would have been nice 1. that the machine has that option, and 2. you have to provide it on your own.

I think that about covers it. And don't pester me with regularly scheduled popups about the need for warranty checkups, like all my other HP stuff does. I like HP products generally. Solid dependable performers. Just filling out this dialog box, reviewing my thoughts, I am starting to consider if I will be an HP customer ever again."
369706783,Others,negative,0.8395298719406128,Printer seems to be flimsy. The piece that pops out to stop paper’s from falling on the floor is flimsy. It’s difficult to insert ink cartridges.

If you try to go around it, it may, but will still not let you use the cartridge that isnt hp.Amazon did a great job getting it to me, and the ""counterfiet "" cartridges were only detected because the printer too may without being replaced. Printers cant actually measure, so it keeps count of the pages I had to wait 3 days for cartridges. Which is BS not amazons fault. HEWLETT PACKARDS FAULT for not giving any warning that the cartridges were STOPPED. They cost me a bundle over those days. I can only hope they go under, their online help is so backed up.

A round of new ink for my printer is $90.  I tried your pay as you go service but I think I was getting hoodwinked.  High monthly fees when we knew we didn't print as many copies as you said.  Since I quit that service I am still using the same cartridges that I purchased them.  No sure how long ago that was.  So I think your pay as you go was a scam.

I have tried turning the printer off and rebooting the PC, no luck.  The other day, it started to work the way it was supposed to, but tonight, several days later, it won't scan to the PC again. You have to reinstall the software, or scan from the PC. Its a nice feature when it works. When any of my HP's crash, its not good feeling because its always when you are in the middle of something and trying to get it done. I do like the ink life. Sometimes if you pull out the tray and close it, it drags on someting internal and you think something will break if you are not careful. It has to be perfectly aligned.But ist not a big deal because HP will discontinue this model and will replace it with a newer model and new ink cartridges.

2. Any print job that got interrupted or did not correctly show up on the printer would cause a spooling error and was very very very very difficult to correct. I wasted a lot of ink and a lot of paper every time my laptop started up it would try printing that spoiled printing job that had failed the previous day. 

Resolving these problems involved a lot of screens to read and diagnosis online in the majority of the time it was to no avail. 

There was no clear instructions on how to just manually adjust the job by using buttons on the printer it instead insisted on using the printer app which was unresponsive or unreliable for the most part.

 I was then advised because I was not using a Smart ink cartridge they had no idea when to send the next smart ink cartridge. I have always bought HP printers in the past but I am not sure if that will happen again now.

On Feb. 22/23, I spoke for 3 hours with someone who was very good but still could not identify the problem.  He arranged a followup call on Feb. 24/23 with Emma who discovered that the printer had the wrong ink cartridges, and not only that, they were all empty.  This was curious as I had never used the printer which had come in a factory-sealed box.  Emma helped me order the proper cartridges and when they arrived, on March 24 I spoke to Jim who helped me install them and finally get the printer working.
I paid $274.01CAD for the printer but with the local technician’s fees and the extra ink I had to buy, the printer ended up costing me over $600CAD.  
All of your technicians that I spoke with were wonderful, so knowledgeable and patient.  I really like your HP Instant Ink Plan.  It’s so reasonable as we pay an atrocious price for ink in our small town.  Thank you."

369927873,Others,negative,0.5346358418464661,"1 - Biggest frustration so far is that you gave me a trial and free copies for each month of that trial.  However you have removed a lot of those free copies (not rolled over).  I was busy during the first few months after buying this, so I lost a lot of free copies that didn't roll over.  Kind of rude to take away copies if you really want to keep me going forward. I lost probably 100 free copies. 
2 - VERY ANNOYED that the printer just starts making noise for no reason at all.  Sounds like it's going through a reset even though I haven't used it for a few hours. If 
I try to print as this happens, nothing prints. Has happened about 10x since getting printer. Only way to stop it is to unplug and restart.  Why? There's also times that the print job doesn't print, have to cancel and reprint.  Not good if you are printing a coupon that is a ONE TIME print.  I lost coupons due to printer not printing. 

3 - why not have words 'color' and 'black and white' on printer for copying? At first didn't know which was color copy button. Trial and error. Should have more features on the printer. 
4 - any calls into HP are very time consuming. 
5 - So far, during the free trial, I haven't yet had to replace the cartridges considering cartridges never last.  Usually cartridges in the past never last this long. 
These types of printers are never long lasting, please make ones that last a long time.  Hard to see ones that are thrown out way too often. Have a recycling program set up with Best Buy stores."

I kept requesting a supervisor. When I was finally able to get a supervisor, the supervisor was able to get the printer up and running in under 20 minutes with minimum effort.

The printer is working.  I was able to scan many documents using the document loader.

I would like to send you a photo of this white plastic object.  

Anyway I send you the old printer for recycle.  I am 74 years old so not easy for me to take the old printer anywhere.  I no longer drive.

I was advised to cancel my instant ink contract in order to change my country location. I was told to remove the instant ink cartridges and I did. I purchased 2 new cartridges ( $113 ) from your company (HP) and the printer did not accept them. I phoned your (HP) service department and spoke to numerous customer service representatives and they tried to rectify the problem. They then said that the printer heads were probably damaged because I used the wrong ink cartridges. I think the customer service representatives were shirking their duties as the cartridges never one time actually worked. Damaged printer heads? Please! Anyway now I’m out over $100 and my printer does not print. Thank you HP for for what? I’m sure I will never purchase another product from your company nor will I ever tell anyone to purchase any product from your company. The entire experience was expensive not to mention a waste of 2 hours and 58 minutes of my life that I never get back.
Overall the service I received was positively awful.

I have several unused cartridges that were purchased for all my prior printers that I'm never able to use.  The ink cartridges are expensive, and it doesn't seem to make sense that every printer has to use a different type.  Can't HP make printers using the same ink cartridge design?

There have been two downsides to my experience with this printer:
1) One set of new Instant Ink cartridges didn't work, but the printer diagnostics weren't able to catch it and I spent hours trying to solve the problem and lost a day of work and wages (I work from home). I finally decided to take those new cartridges out and install others, but because I had a work deadline to meet, I couldn't wait for another set of cartridges to arrive in the mail, and had to go purchase cartridges from the store.  When I installed those, the printer worked.  Every set of cartridges that has been mailed to me after that has worked.  

2) Every time you make an update to the HP Smart software through which we access the printer, there is no email notification, or no quick tutorial to run me through the changes.  I just get surprised that the configuration changes, and have to spend time hunting for functions that were obvious before and aren't now, and that costs me extra time when I have deadlines to meet at work. It would be much better if, every time there's an update that reconfigures the user interface, there's a quick tutorial that walks users through the changes and where to find things."

Minnesota and is used infrequently,  I received a shipment of printer ink cartridge, when I had probably not yet printed 30 pages.  So I cancelled the subscription.  So when my original cartridge finally was emptied, I installed the cartridge that was sent to me pursuant to my ink supply program.  Yet, now when I attempt to print a document I get a message that my printer is disabled because the ink cartridge wasn’t supplied by the ink cartridge supply program…which is untrue.  My belief is hp is extorting its customers under a “must buy” ink cartridge supply contract that exceeds the actual ink cartridge needs of its customers.  I plan to return the printer to Costco and log a complaint against go’s business practices and file a complaint with the FTC."

I went ahead and put in the ink that came with and agreed to the plan.

Then I started getting email about the ink use and the paper use.  It just became so confusing.  Since I had brought ink, I put the new ink in that I bought.  Just a mess."

We spoke with him and he told us he would refund us 2 ink cartridges , which was way less than the amount we had paid for.

There is no way in my account at HP to view my ink subscription to verify that the correct printer is on subscription (I have three HP printers).

I attempted to print and immediately was informed that even though the ink was close to full i had to pay a subscription to use the printer. After about 45 mins i finaly get it set up and ready to run, then print head error. fix that and then print and it had a few mistakes but after some fine tuning i was able to get it. Now i go to print again and i have another error for print heads..... i find it obnoxious to pay a subscription for ink for a printer and to have a set number of pages im allowed to print per month on my printer, then to not even have it work. I have always had issues with HP printers, i warned myself about going with an HP, but thought maybe they have figured it out... nope you just have figured out how to milk a consumer with another faulty throw away product. I will not buy another HP. either for work or for home. the 100K MJF my work bought was a Joke and that trickled down to this POS. I will be removing my subscription and tossing this printer into the garbage. Thanks HP for another piece of trash."

 And now with the stupidly unprofitable rise."
370374951,Others,positive,0.34505102038383484,"First, the printer seems to print, and the print quality is ok.  Sadly, that was about the only thing that was ok.

However, it was frankly utterly ridiculous process getting it work that stops this being a 10.

It took me over 2 hours to get the printer working, and almost all of that was trying to get the software set up.  Filling after that with ink was reasonably easy.

1. The printer could not find my phone, and in spite of putting the phone on top of the printer, for 30 mins just kept telling me every few minutes ""Weak Bluetooth Connection"".  Apparently there was nothing I could do to change that.

2. For no apparent reason, the printer then started to talk to the phone. Why, I have no idea...

3.It refused to connect to the Wi-Fi network, and told me the password was incorrect, in spite of the password being EXACTLY correct.

4. Three attempts later, with the same password each time, it finally connected.

5.  The pictures in the setup guide of how to fill the tanks and the animated diagrams for this were individually useless, made even more so because the animated guide just jumped, and missed out, many / most of the essential steps.

6.  I managed to do the assembly and ink setup in spite of the instructions, not because of them.

7. In particular, the printhead alignment guide was worse than useless.

8. I then attempted to use HP Smart on the phone to set up an account, but mistyped one letter in my email. Fortunately I noticed this, and was told I could change this later.  On attempting to change this, having put in the correct email, it told me ""This username is not available"".  Attempting to re-imput the correct email, it told me ""You have changed your information too many times."" [Really - twice?] ""Please try again later"". 

As you can probably gather from all of the above, my setup was anything other than easy, and taking over two hours, did not inspire any confidence whatsoever.  The clearly wrong and useless error messages didn't make the experience any better.

I was thoroughly delighted when I discovered that the printer would work from the Apple print software already on both my laptop and desktop, and I certainly don't intend to have anything else to do with what I consider to be bug ridden and unreliable HP Smart software.

Sadly it doesn't end there.

The web address listed on the extended warranty flyer is wrong, and leads to a dead end.

The printheads have a one year warranty, which suggests for a printer that is ostensibly warranted for 3 years and has up to 3 years worth of ink, it might be a good idea to buy a spare of each. Sadly both the black and tricolour printheads are out of stock on the HP website.

So, not a great experience so far., and hence the 3/10 score"
370375288,Others,positive,0.7804132103919983,I think the printer has a nice footprint. It prints really well and set up was straight forward. Photos are great. My only problem was that one of the cartridges that came with the printer did not work. I tried to go thru the app for replacement but could not find a way to do it so I spent $36 at staples for a cartridge and then was sent an email stating I should not use purchased ink. A bit backward…..right? I had no intention of stopping pink.

I therefore believed I had paid for my ink. Once I decided to cancel the contract I was horrified that you would not allow the cartridges to run out, but immediately put a block on them.

So I call the HP tech
Support number that I got off on instant ink subscription app. The tech assured  me he could fix it, but he ended up turning me over to to his supervisor,  long story short, your company that I have trusted for years turn me over to a scammer, who proceeded to to convince me that I had to give him control of my smart phone to he could install the printer without the instant ink subscription. While he had control of my phone, he stole money from my vemo account, my bank checking account, and got on Amazon and bought 300.00 worth of gift cards.

My usage is sporadic...some months I'll print 20+ pages, and some months 0.  There is no subscription that works for me (as far as I know), since I'll be paying for months when I don't print, and will pay a surcharge for other months if I go over my monthly subscription amount.

Also, my printer goes off line sometimes, so I need to call customer service to repair."

That, and the 50% price increase shortly after my subscription began, leaves me less than 100% satisfied."

I’m in my mid sixties and I have used a lot of different types of printers. This last HP printer I have purchased! I noticed that it consumes ink, more ink than they give me to use for a year. The printer tray is to small and will not hold very much paper and this maybe optional however it’s a big problem for me. There is no port to insert a thumb drive. Also this printer seems to jam a lot. I still have a half of a box left of paper from my previous hp printer! That printer rocks! It still worked fine when I got rid of it, the only problem I couldn’t get ink cartridges for it anymore! I love it so much I purchased expired ink cartridges from eBay. I ended realizing I needed to get another one so I gave my old printer to a college student who loved it. Anyway I can go on and on the bottom line is I am not happy with my HP office jet Pro 8025E all in one printer! HP you people can do better than this scrap plastic and nuts and bolts! I kept deleting these review options because I didn’t want throw HP under the bus until now! If you are going to make junk printers someone needs to tell you about it! Ok I’m done!

370536752,Others,negative,0.9471324682235718,"This printer frequently disconnects from the network!  Its on/off button frequently or USUALLY does nothing to wake it up, and so we must actually unplug its power supply from the mains (household) circuit to wake it up!  Now, I think that is just crap!  The print quality on photographs is quite variable, whether-or-not we are using HP paper.  I prefer to use some art papers we have.  The paper sizes available from the HP menu are rather limited.  You online support is usually incompetent, and your virtual support is 99.9% useless.  Otherwise, it would be a satisfactory printer.  For the record, if I want a better printed image, I use my Epson, or for the best, I use a multi-cartridge Canon, but don'.t use the Canon as often as I would like because of ink delivery issues, timeliness, etc.  We love instant Ink, usually."
370538079,Others,negative,0.9720979928970337,The printer is great however I am greatly disappointed that because I chose not to continue the ink replacement service and there is still ink in the cartridges I have to go purchase new ones. Some months I print a lot and some I don't print any. This is very disappointing.
370538889,Others,negative,0.6970883011817932,"The printer works well.  It is fast, the prints look great and, being an all in one. it is versatile.  I love the automatic 2-sided printing and copying.  But I do have 2 issues with the printer though.  The biggest issue is the amount of color ink it uses.  I initially signed up for Instant Ink but stopped because I am not a regular enough user each month to justify it.  So, I use the regular cartridges.  I ran out of color very quickly even though I print very little color.  Nearly all I print is black and white documents.  I have printed less than 2 dozen pages with some color (not photographs) on them.  I do not understand why it uses so much color.  That is costly and a nuisance.  The second issue was with paper jams.  It was jamming quite a bit until I figured out that the paper tray holder pinches the pages too tightly from the sides when there are only a few pages left in the tray.  Once I figured that out, I made sure it had plenty of paper.  That seems to have resolved the issue.  But it shouldn't jam even if there is only 1 page left, especially since it is usually pretty difficult to clear the jam.  The reason it commonly had only a few pages in the paper tray was I was using different colors of paper on different projects so I would only load just about enough for what I was printing at the time.   Sometimes it was only 1 or 2 pages.
I do have one other issue.  That is with Instant Ink.  It sounds great but it is only good if you are fairly consistent in the number of pages you print each month.  As it is it's way too much trouble monitoring the number of pages printed trying to optimize the number of pages printed each month.  If you go over your selected amount you pay a higher price per page than your monthly rate.  It cost $1 if you go over by just 1 page.  That's ridiculous.  And going over 10 pages is $1 or 10 cents per page.  That's higher than most of the monthly plans."

At the beginning it seemed like a neat way of staying on top of things. But the Free duration came up and it no longer allowed you to print unless you renewed your subscription. I canceled the subscription and I was able to print, for a few days. Then, it would not allow me to print because the ink cartridges were special and only for the subscription plan.

It took her around 45 minutes to verify that I had a bad cartridge from you that came with my new printer. She had to logme in to figure it out. I then had to wait many days to get my cartridge.

As it turned out, I'm not sure I ever used the subscription ink -- at some point I got a threatening email about it so I canceled the subscription. So I had a complete set of toner cartridges that I paid for and could not use -- but no instructions about restoring the printer to original settings in other to avoid a service hampering error message. I spent 2 hours on the phone with your minimally English-speaking agent to resolve the problem. It was all a very disappointing experience."

The hp will go to the dump if I can’t find someone to give it to. I got one shipment of ink after spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how to order one. (I thought hp was tracking my usage and would automatically send more ink when I was low. But I actually ran out and no ink was sent.) so I cancelled the ink subscription plan before my free trial was up and then I couldn’t print because the ink would only work with an active subscription?!? Even though it was almost brand new? Then I didn’t print anything for about 8 months because I was so upset about the ink not working. Then I needed to print something so I ordered what I thought was hp ink from Amazon but it was apparently not official hp ink so it would not work. That did it! I went out and bought an Epson printer. Seems much sturdier than the hp. Was quite a bit cheaper than the hp and the ink is about half the price of hp. I love my Epson printer! Will never buy anything hp again.

Nothing works better than a one on one  actual speaking telephone conversation. I hope you can share this email with those persons responsible for customer relations.

Installation does not work correctly with Windows 10, and certainly not with 11, and I seriously doubt HP will get it's act together with 12. I called 3x and was on the phone over SIX damned hours and even the rep had no clue what was wrong!
I wouldn't buy another HP, if I was paid. Well, maybe I'd buy it; use the money to buy ANYTHING ELSE, and throw the HP out the window, 
I think HP should be shut down, or, at the very least the entire board of directors fired, and new intelligent replacements brought in. 
Why not? EVERY purchase (hardware) has been difficult to get set-up correctly; some hardware fails, miserably within months, I had a 2 year warranty with Sams Club, that included ""In home repair"", but, HP tried to not accept it-- even with the Sam's Club rep on the phone. Several days later someone with a modicum (little) of intelligence figured out the warranty service, sent someone to replace the hard drive; despite pleading with the guy to stay, until completion, because something ALWAYS goes wrong when I'm told, ""Nothing ever goes wrong""-- it did, and he had to come back at another time. (Which delayed me getting my work done on time). 
Within 6 months THAT hard drive failed. 
So to short tell it:
1. Drivers are difficult to install.  
2. Getting a sucky-ass rep is hard enough, much less a good one. Almost impossible, actually.
3. Hardware failures.
4. Denial of services, even though it's in writing. 
5. With HP, you truly get what you pay for. More bang for your buck, but, in the end, you feel like you got shot in the head. 
6. In short, one of the single worst companies. 

Too bad, too. Prior to this millennia, HP stood behind it's product, had great customer service. An easy to find toll free number. Since: Hellacious Products (that must be what the HP stands for these days), Finding Waldo on a solid black page is a lot easier than finding a damned phone number to customerless support."

I predict I will print less than 20 pages in a year and clearly having ink delivered every month would be an horrendous expense and not needed.

I think, like many companies, HP are whizzing forward in technology, offering pictures and diagrams that are often not understood by the older generation, and there are millions of us.

371257107,Others,positive,0.39391541481018066,"I've always used HP products. My old HP all-in-one printer didn't have the ink option of instant ink program and it was using a full cartridge with just a few sheets printed because it would dry up due to lack of use. So I bought the new printer the deskjet 2700. I think. I set it up. It worked great on all three of my devices, a Chromebook, a pixel phone, and a Windows 10 computer.

When I printed a few copies successfully, a few minutes later the printer went off line yet the little blue light that says it's online was still on and it was still connected to the internet. According to my information from Xfinity doing a live connection test when I couldn't connect it and when the printer.couldn't connect it, none of my devices could connect.

I talked to several agents after 2 days of doing virtual support options that didn't lead anywhere. After hours of tech support failing I was scheduled a call back from a product specialist. That callback never came. So I called in. Got another call back that call back. Never came. Then I talked to support. They said that the printer had to be bad so I returned the printer. I was told it would be safe to order the same printer so I ordered the all-in-one 2700 desk yet again when it came i set it up successfully in a few minutes and it printed fine and I was happy but after less than 30 minutes it was offline and none of my devices could connect to it again. My router had a strong connection and was 1 ft away. One gigabyte router. My internet showed an excellent connection.

My internet has been rock solid for the last several years. I don't have any problems with any other devices and from what I can see I don't have any trouble connecting to the printer from the router. After the printer is gone off to sleep several minutes after that it goes offline to my devices but not offline to the internet yet. I get several emails from this printer and the last from HP saying it's my responsibility to keep an ongoing internet connection when I'm finding it in possible to do.

So I called support hopefully for the last time. Told him the story wasted everybody's time didn't mean to. The support agent suggested that a product specialist call me for the third time. I still haven't received that call. It's been 2 days now so am going to wait a couple more days and then I'm going to return it and I'm going to have to buy another brand I'm afraid. I would really like it if HP would read this and come through and offer some support because I would help him solve it if it was a bug I've had many years at in technical support myself. So I understand the challenge that this gives you and me because from what I read, there's a whole bunch of people that purchased this in the last month and what percentage of them are having this problem. If it's a hardware problem, I'd like to help resolve it. If not, I'd like to get another printer and if HP offers me a different brand that's similar. I would be excited to try something different. This is taken hours. Maybe 40 hours my time so far and haven't given up yet. Thanks for listening. Bye"

The first I ordered from Amazon because they had faster shipping that HP did.  It never arrived, and I needed a printer, so I went down to Staples on 2/22/24 and bought one.  It wouldn't set up because of a leaky ink cartridge (cyan).  Staples replaced the printer, after much fuss with their technical support.  This printer set up but kept jamming and tearing paper during the paper picking process.  So, I called HP support and after a few hours, determined they would send me a replacement printer.  This was on 2/23/24, a Friday.  I paid for next business day (2/26/24) shipping and was told it would be delivered on 2/28/24.  2/28/24 came and went with nary a word from HP.  I contacted support and all they would tell me was to wait for it to be delivered.  Finally, on 3/14/24 I was notified that it had shipped and would be delivered on 3/22/24.  On 3/15/24 it was delivered.  It set up and seems to be working as it should."

371304537,Others,negative,0.6546311974525452,"It is absolutely ridiculous that a small mistake in the set up - putting blue ink in the Black ink tank, can mean that one has to go out and buy a new printer. There is no work around or easy repair. This is a design error and makes one very nervous about buying the product. Judging from the internet, I am not the only one, in a ""senior moment"" to make this error. The instructions need to be very clear at the stage and warn people that they will be buying a new printer if they make a mistake here.

The set up program - i.e. registering first as an HP customer was terrible. I gave it 1/10. I ended up in so many dead ends. Having had an HP before, I didn't know if I was already registered. Apparently, I wasn't. At the end of the registration process there was no link back to the set up program. I tried the other HP tab on my computer and it just told me to go to such and such. Again, NO link provided. I went round and round in circles getting no where. Finally I went back to the Windows store t reload the software. It told me I already had it and offered to open it for me. Then I saw the button I needed and the actual set up program was quite good, but lacks sufficient warning on the ink issue. I am told that Epson has a design that prevents you emptying the wrong ink into the tank.
The when I was asked what I would like to do to lose the case I asked for a replacement printer at cost price. All I was offered was the next model down at 18% off. I bought my original printer at 40% off and I was able to find my printer retail at a much cheaper price than you were offering on a cheaper printer! I hold you responsible for poor design and I expect you to ""share the pain"" if something like this happens.

First, the Cyan and Magenta inks started switching in the sensors I guess. Then those 2 colors were so faded that the overall picture was terrible! Then HP changed my printer name again and again as I originally bought this printer as the HP OfficeJet Pro 6970 and in my printer selection it would randomly change name variations. The printer constantly had issues with Cups. Until finally the printer stopped working altogether. I continually contacted HP and I was told that I didn't qualify for help!

In terms of print quality, this printer delivers sharp, vibrant results every time.
Additionally, the wireless connectivity options make it convenient to print from any device, whether it's my laptop, smartphone, or tablet.

I was told this when I contacted y'all about sending me the starter set up again again that I had to send back and y'all charged me to send me the right ink back. it's a monthly subscription and a charge when they have to send me ink and paper. I was told that I would only be charged when they had to send ink or paper to me because I run low which is another thing I'm upset about. Also the printing isn't very clear it's the slightest bit blurred no matter what I do and iv contacted y'all about in the past. Also it's horrible with printing colored pictures of people. If I still had the receipt I would cancel my subscription and return the printer for a printer that doesn't charge me constantly that I can still use and print however many pages I want.

371328909,Price,negative,0.9790642857551575,It’s too expensive and when you cancel they lock up your computer even though you’ve paid for more than what the ink cartridge is worth.

Replacing cartridges is easy.. computer is reliable... prints well"
371331243,Others,positive,0.813079297542572,It's a not so fancy printer - it does what I need to get done. The ink is much more expensive than I realized! I run out quickly and I don't do a lot of printing. I would love to make copies of photos but the ink prohibits me from doing so!
371331264,Others,negative,0.976527988910675,I would not recommend an hp printer. My printer has not been working for months. I have wasted so much time trying to get it to print. There is ink in the cartridges and it will not print. The quality of new hp printers is not what it used to be. I loved our old hp printer but this one sucks!
371331476,Others,negative,0.7345215082168579,"This is my second HP printer where I have subscribe to the instant ink. The print head on the first printer failed after several years. Based on my experience, I purchased the current printer. 
I was disappointed to discover that the 8025e does not scan double sided documents -- although it does copy 2 sided pages. 
I am also having issues with either my printer head or cartridges. I have cleaned the printhead multiple times and it has not solved the problem. Upon examination of the cartridges, I discovered that the color cartridges are contaminated with a dark ink. I have tried to clean them by blotting with a paper towel to no avail. 
The website does not provide any support for this issue. 
When I went to a chat and described the issue, I was told that I could talk to a person but would have to pay for the $1 initial fee, which would then be reimbursed. When I followed directions, I was then informed that I was being billed for $56. I didn't complete the purchase as it was an unexpected charge."
371331546,Price,positive,0.8846716284751892,It is an ok very basic printer for the price.  Printers and ink are too high as it is.  Getting a better quality printer is too expensive these days.  It does the printing fine.  Scanning is one sheet at a time which sometimes is a big of a hassle.  Wish I understood the function buttons better.
371332062,Others,negative,0.6603914499282837,"Because it ran out of ink within a month and my husband, the only one who uses it, didn't print that any pages. Also won't hook up to my laptop."

371332901,Others,positive,0.43036627769470215,It would be good for somebody who uses the printer all the time. I didn't realize I had to pay a monthly fee. I had to refill my black ink and have not gotten a refill it's been about a week. You were also charging me $4.24 for 2 months and now it has gone up to $5.30 with no explanation

The thing is, stores sell these devices, but say, after a year, the ink cartridges may no longer be on sale. If you ask, they will compare the price. There is often a suggestion: buy a new printer...in this way, it's so-called waste accumulates in the world. So this system of yours is good for our whole EARTH!!! One problem I have: how could I change my payment account to my normal current account so that I could personally make the payment. So I would not like to use the visa fee. Hi.

I like to keep two extra cartridges in house, as I sometimes need to do a WHOLE LOT of printing at one time. And I found out I can’t use store bought ink if I run out. 

I don’t remember the exact things I went through, but I could not get a person on the phone. All I remember is being very upset. 

And it’s annoying because I really loved the service."
371335332,Others,positive,0.5807936787605286,Since I bought this printer you’ve yet to send me ink so I’m presuming when I need it you’ll send it. I do trust that. It’s always been amazing in the past.
371335706,Others,negative,0.6388455629348755,"Our HP printer is efficient & works well for us. Only negative side is the ink cartridges are very expensive, about 2/3rds of the cost of the printer."
371336260,Others,negative,0.732562243938446,I was supposed to receive a year of free ink and nothing has arrived in the mail.  Additionally the color ink has run out much more quickly than marketed.
371336498,Others,positive,0.9279497861862183,"It was easy to set up and takes up very little space; was also a reasonable price. HP ink cartridges expensive and have to be changed out quite frequently even though ours aren’t very big print jobs. Even more expensive then to have to send print jobs to a store to be printed then picked up. Also when cartridges changed out, the new scanner recalibration process wasn’t straightforward and also takes time to go through. If I didn’t have to print papers and presentations on the fly, I wouldn’t have this printer. I just now need to keep extra cartridge on gand a leave time for the inconvenient setup and test print."
371336722,Others,negative,0.697763979434967,I have no support from HP even though I contacted them regarding the ink cartridges.  I finally called them and thankfully I spoke to someone who listened to my concerns
371336794,Price,positive,0.7410258650779724,Months ago I enrolled the program. It’s my first review. Unsure if will continue. Positive is the cheap prices. Negative (or wondering) is that I want to make the decision of ordering new cartridges not let the system order and charge me. Tks
371336837,Others,positive,0.970158576965332,"Our printer has worked perfectly. One annoyance is the pull-out paper tray binds on pulling it out or pushing it back in. It's cheap feeling. A puzzling thing is once in a while the printer just starts going like it does when I put new ink cartridges in, but it goes even longer than that. I know at least one person who took my recommendation and bought the same printer. It prints crisp text and excellent everyday printing color. The scanning works great, too."
371337288,Others,positive,0.8952797651290894,I don’t print much so I find this a good way to get ink w/o trying to know when ink is needed.

Your 3 months of ""free"" cartridges is something I view with distaste as a way of getting my credit card number now in the hopes I'll forget about it going forward.  If you were more sincere, you'd put 3 replacement cartridges in the box.

371366332,Others,negative,0.4524570405483246,I do not  have much experience with other brands to compare. The setup instructions were simple and easy so I think it is odd that there are no instructions to insert ink cartridges which is more difficult to do than rest of instructions.

We have wasted so much paper as when using the wireless facility and printing from another room, we do not realise that it is printing large documents for a second time when we have instructed the printer to cancel that document.  It has been a very large disappointment but we are not in a position to revert to the machine that we so liked before."

I had more ink cartridges that failed (DOA) than ever before and now they ""expire"" ?  Finally, the printer just isn't up to snuff - while it works well for weeks, at times, it just fails to print a photo correctly.  It also drops off my wifi network at times.  The scanner works, but only with my computer utilities not with HP SMART.    Really poor software and support is even worse than ever - why bother ?

When there was a power outage or the wifi was down, the printer had to be reset.  It would not print. In every case I had to call the help line and have someone go into my com;pter and reset it so the printer would work.  This would take at least an hour.  

I finally dropped out of the ink program only to find that Staples and Best Buy, did not supply the right HP ink.  What good is a printer without ink? 

I sold the printer last June for $5 at a yard sale and bought an Epson.  I like the HP when it worked, but what good is a printer with no ink or won't let you print. 

I can't imagine designing a program that could lose customers like the HP Instant Ink Subscription.  I'm typing on an HP laptop right now.  I love HP products but that Ink program should be replaced."

1. For printer 1 I opted for the subscription. You urged me several times to keep the printer on in order to keep track of the ink levels. 
The results were unacceptable flaws in the print quality. My suspicion was that keeping it on might lead to drying up of the print heads. 
When I keep the printer off when I don't have anything to print, the print quality is better. 
2. I cancelled the subscription a few weeks ago because I don't print that much but need the scanner much more. Then I needed to print a document urgently, and was surprised that the cartridges were not working any more - because of the cancelled subscription.
I had no choice than to install a new printer in a hurry, one we got with the new PC for my wife some months ago. 
3. I understand your policy to sell as many cartridges as possible. But you don't explain the nature of the first batch of cartridges and its limitations for the customer. 
4. I don't come back to my bad experience with your online support, when several customer service officers from India, all told me different stories about the problem.  Fortunately, one of them hinted at a way to solve it myself after hours of fiddling. 
5. For many years I have been a satisfied and faithful customer of HP, but the last months have been frustrating. I had already calculated to switch to Appel, but waited because of the cost.

On a whim replaced half used HP cartridges with new cartridges that came with the new printer and it worked. Totally ridiculous. Will not buy HP printer next time.
371647760,Others,negative,0.7960878610610962,"The main reason is that one part of the set-up instructions said to ""remove ALL tape (emphasis mine) from the ink cartridges supplied with the printer.  Accordingly, I tried to remove both pieces of tape, thereby disabling that cartridge.  Luckily I only did that once. Another reason is that the instructions failed to mention that before the printer can be connected to my wifi not only does the printer need to be turned on, but also the cartridges need to be installed."

I like that it gives me savings, but recently I replaced my printer with a printer that was given to me as a gift. It was an upgrade, but it was not store bought new. It was almost a new, from a friend. 
   When I registered the printer it did not immediately send me ink. It apparently thought that the printer was a brand new one that had ink that came with the purchase. It was registering that I was all set on ink, which I was not. It said we had to wait 10 days for the shipment from our new welcome kit. We are not new subscribers. We've been customers for several years. 
      The dashboard said that the ink was on the way but we still have not received it as of this writing. I went out and bought new ink because we couldn't wait."

This is my first time subscribing to instant ink but I'm looking forwards to the process and convenience. My friend has been on the program for years and has been telling me to get on it for the past year. But as long as my experience works as well as it has for her, I don't know why I waited as long as I did. 
Excited to start the program. AAAAANNNND......to save some money 😁😁"
371708907,Others,negative,0.8978670239448547,I ended up enrolled in the printer ink program but no ink was ever sent to me. I canceled due to that fact and my printer became useless. I only able to use one type of ink. It is the smallest container that does not last long at all because if I put the larger containers in my printer tells me that it is not compatible with the printer ink program and will not print. I reached out to customer service and technical support multiple times and never received a single response. I live overseas on military base and therefore was not able to call. But I ended up staying up odd hours and paid make a phone call only to get hung up on. I have actively encouraged people not to by HP printers. As soon as I am somewhere where I can purchase any other brand I will.

My only complaint is the lack of instructions. I realize I can look them up online and print them, but that is time consuming and the use of my paper and ink. Just simple straight forward directions that could be looked at for reference would be very helpful."

371713601,Product Quality,positive,0.7576610445976257,First the ink that came with the printer only printed 5 pages and needed ink. So I was sucked into your ink scam since now I have not run out since the first week. The printer requires me to play with it every time I want to print. Finally after months I discovered if I leave it on it's fine. Not pleased. I have had HP printers in the past that lasted for years.

Knowing how many pages I print each month should be illegal and is frankly none of your business.  Not allowing a person to buy any ink they want to, especially when your genuine ink is so expensive, compared to generics. and money is so tight these days, and then not allowing the printer to work if the ink isn't HP brand, is unethical, at the very least.  I can buy a complete set of generic inks for less than it costs for 1 ink from HP, and there is more ink in the generic cartridges.  I will never buy another HP printer again as long as this crap continues."

The connection is quick and print material is perfect. I’ve been stuck on HP for 15 years I know what to expect. I love having the option of having the ink ship. I did have an issue when I first bought the printer where the ink was not being registered which caused me to completely run out of ink. Had to go to the store and buy ink but then I called HP help and told him the situation and was reimbursed.

This app makes it easy for me to print scan and the hopefully automated ink replacement system will be helpful. The printer itself is compact and looks good in my shared bedroom/office. As I will be writing on a regular basis I will have more opportunities to utilize it more frequently.

So we thought we’d upgrade and so far not so good. Difficult to print from the computer have to go to HP app and print….but it’s always asleep and by chance we can get it to print. Our old one turned on when. We hit print on the computer now we need to turn it off then back on a real inconvenient thing after all these years of good service from our old reliable HP 8200. Loved that one!
371723497,Product Quality,negative,0.9186104536056519,"Too often it's difficult to connect to Wifi.  There are conflicts between HP's printer app and Microsoft's printer controls, but I can't rely on just one of them to do what I want to do.
It disables 3rd-party cartridges, which has cost implications for me and adverse implications for the environment.  If this feature can now be disabled, then please let me know.  HP deceives users with ink-dependent printers by disabling scanners when the ink is low, despite that ink isn't necessary for scanning.  These aspects make HP a large turn-off."
371724076,Others,negative,0.921647846698761,"The instant ink wouldn’t send me ink because it said it didn’t have internet- yet I could print from my phone, so it must have had it.  When I decided after two years to cancel it- bought my own ink- it said I could only use authentic Hp ink.  I bought the printer- I should be able to use recycled ink cartridges.  I have signed up for instant ink again- so I could print my son’s homework, but, this is the last HP I will own.  It feels a bit too invasive that I can’t use whatever ink I want after buying the printer."
371724081,Others,negative,0.8823058605194092,The Ink scam; you put a new (expensive) cartridge in and then the printer expels half of it with a test page. I also bought ink in the HP box; in the HP sealed wrapper and the printer would not accept it.
371725094,Others,negative,0.9539409875869751,"Seems like the ink cartridges went empty awful soon. Keeps showing an error “no paper” and it has paper. Have to reposition paper in tray then it will print one copy then do it again. I do like using the hp app to print. Cannot find where it tells me ink levels, all it says is im using hp cartridges.

371748702,Others,negative,0.39222660660743713,"I am not overly savvy when it comes to technology.  On my first call for help setting up, I was of the notion that when done it would work completely.  Later I found out that my copy part was not set up and so I could not copy anything.  It required another phone call.  I found it hard to get through on a phone call to get the help I needed.

Furthermore, I feel as if by buying your machine I am being owned by you as to how my machine will work as it does not come with all the software set up on it so that it is fully ready to use.  

Also, I have to bow down to you regarding ink and enter into a business arrangement where I will not have help with my machine if I do not get ink only from you.  Also, in getting ink directly from you, I have to keep track of how much I am printing to know what plan to buy without falling short of getting ink if I need it sooner than i had expected or paying for a large plan and not get all the ink I paid for if I had a slack time printing.  I have periods of not needing to print hardly anything and then periods where I am doing a project and do a huge amount of printing.  You hold over me that I have to pay more to get less ink if I buy at a local store.  Why can't you offer your customers the option to get the same cartridges with the same amount of ink at the same price at stores as by mail.

I find this frustrating and disappointing.  Therefore, I do not feel I would be doing right to family and friends to recommend their get an HP printer.

I am sure you are thinking you have done a wonderful thing, however, it has not helped to make a seamless trasition from an old printer to your new system."

After six months and only one refill, I knew a subscription didn’t make sense. So I refused the offer to continue. Around the time period was up, I needed to do some urgent printing. And what happened? You ceased my printer and sent me an email that I had to return the cartridges. I had discarded the box and had no idea where to send them. I tried to research the address on your website and sent an email to customer service. Nothing! In the meantime, when I was desperate to have a working printer, it was frozen. I quickly ordered ink from Amazon but when it arrived I realized it was not the HP brand. Because I really needed to print documents, I installed the ink. Nope! I received the very self-serving message that it was not genuine HP ink so would not work.  So then I had to order again. 
When a company is not there for a customer, why would the customer return to the company? I will never buy another HP printer.  I have shared this story with friends and told them to NEVER use the “free” ink program and they should  probably avoid HP all together."

I call and spend hours on the phone and I want to lower the copies and they agree.  Then apparently you have to go through the whole process a second time to supposedly get the correct amount of pages.  I was told $3.99 and now I see that you have billed me from $12.99 to $6.99 for several months, never the $3.99 I agreed to.  It is such a bait and switch and hassle.

Not to mention you will brick the printer if I need a quick ink replacment where I don't want to pay for your overpriced cartridges in the store. The only saving grace is the quality of the print. All in all, the downside is a business plan that actually does not care about the individual user.  

P.S. there are easier ways to hack into a computer than through an ink cartridge."

I feel certain I can get any help I may need from HP.
372261045,Others,positive,0.762560248374939,"The printer is a bit more complicated than my previous Desk Jet 2540 but I am getting used to it.  Print quality is much higher.  I like the paper tray as ""stuff"" used to get into the internals of the 2540. Once hooked up wirelessly to my iMac, seems to work and display similarly. Wish the scanning bed was a full 14"" to cover legal size but then The paper tray would be much bigger so I'll deal with it.
Getting set up with the instant ink program was a hassle and communication w/HP a struggle.  FInally got it settled.  Seems like it will be more economical than even generic cartridges.  Sometimes I would buy an extra ink cartridge so I wouldn't run out and when I finally got to use the extra cartridge it was dried out (?) and wouldn't work  I'd have to toss it, full of ink and lost money trying to save.  Let's see how this system works.

All in all pretty happy the first 8 or 10 days."

Very intuitive and fast.
I had a canon Pixma and was difficult and the ink failed and was complicated to fix. The office supply man told me they do not fix this problem.
The only negative is I bought at Apple store and when I got home found out there was no ink and that is when I found I had to apply for it over the web and it counts the pages you use to see how much ink ypu have used.
I use the printer very little and am not sure I will enjoy this procedure and may end up paying more in the long run. This will totally and continually make me upset.
I am retired and still spend a couple of hours everyday dealing with surveys and unproductive message from a plethora of businesses and political hacks.

Sadly, we are disappointed.
1. The main issue is that there is no way to know what is happening.  I get messages occasionally saying it is in an ""Error state"" but there is no clue as to what is wrong.
2. Over the weekend I was printing a small run of pictures.  The colour cartridge ran out and there was no indication that it was running low - no error message.
3. The lights on it are quite bright.  The printer is in a bedroom and is too bright to be left on but we are told to keep the printer on all the time.
4. Why is the on off switch in such an awkward place - I presume it is to encourage us to keep the printer on but that is not going to be practical for us.
5. Sometimes when I go to print something it tells me the printer is offline when it isn't.  I have to wait for about 3 or 4 minutes and it will eventually print.

372321093,Others,negative,0.9332112073898315,"1- you have made the printers ONLY accept HP ink. That is like buying a car and only being able to put their gas in it. 
2- **THE BIGGEST ISSUE** the HP- 6000 makes a high pitched whine or squeal noise at ALL times! I have gone on-line and this seems to be an issue with HP. I am super disappointed that it can not be fixed. The printer sits about 10 feet away and it is distracting, causes headaches and will not stop.  This is crazy to think you allow this product to be sold with it making that loud of a noise. And for your department to tell me there is no fix? 
3- You force a customer to agree to your terms and join your ""smart print"" plan just to operate the printer, this is NOT listed on the box and not disclosed prior to paying, hooking up and turning it one, so at that point it can not be returned. 
Thank you for reminding me about this survey , as I am also posting the review on all the social media sights. HP hides the fact that you have to use HP ink, and the noise is unbearable . You should be embarrassed by your product and your choice to limit customer prior to purchase that you have to use your ink and the noise issue."

I am docking points because that is the aspect that is most confusing. I tried to find information on your website but the language you use is not for novices and so I decided to learn through trial and error. Since I’ve only just started I don’t know what to expect yet. I am also finding it exceedingly difficult to link up secondary devices to my printer — the app is not easy to use for me but maybe I’ll get used to it over time.

I’d have paid more for the option to have on-hand an additional set of ink cartridges; or that printer would come with a “jumbo”/largest available ink supply cartridges. 2). The “app” I found somewhat frustrating. I’m okay with current technologies but not a master. And that’s the point. I managed through it successfully, but others would not be able to compete. In addition, there seemed to be redundant emphasis on redirection to join ink refill supply program.  - - I purchased “this” printer (I own a larger and more sophisticated HP printer and HP computer system). for my Dad due to it being the most simplicity for operation. At 89 yrs., he “just wants to copy” (maybe 10 pages a month). Any printing he wants, I’ll do it for him, but such will be rare."

A big insight occurred when I discovered that the wifi cable went into the port covered by a decal. Removing that decal was a big insight! Still the printer could not print a job from my computer tower with Windows 10. So I gave up. Then about 2-3 hours later (true!) the printer came awake! I send it a PDF to print and it worked! Later I printed some calendar sheets I once created. That worked too! I haven't yet tried a third job, but I shall soon. 

I think I misunderstood HP's offer to supply ink cartridges and paper. I rarely print anything. If the ink and paper is shipped automatically to me, I do not need this service! I use one package of paper in a year or so. I misunderstood. I thought that I would inform HP when I needed ink or paper. I shall try to cancel this service next week."

It’s not nearly as good at responding to my print jobs as the HP was but the quality of what it prints far exceeds the HP.

The lag between the printer and the computer is such that I cannot tell if a print job is complete, or even occurring so I've accidentally printed more than was intended. I had to search for the printer queue myself - no instructions were included about where that is.  And, even though I was printing only in black, my colour ink did not stay full.  Then I found the default setting was to use both colour and black even if only printing in black.  All of this leads me to believe you just want me to buy more ink.

I am 93 years old and speak from the viewpoint of someone that age.  I object to being coerced into installing H+ which offers me nothing that I want or will use.  I am enticed by the offer of free ink for six months and automatic refills at reduced cost for ink but for a recurring fee of $7.99 per month whether I get any ink or not.  The reduced cost of ink was stated as more than 50% off retail.  Without knowing the retail cost since the cartridges will be larger than basic retail cartridges, how can I figure whether this offer really benefits me.  I used less-expensive-than-HP-retail other source cartridges for the 6500 successfully for over 20 years and see that those sources offer 7955e cartridges cheaper than HP retail.

 All that I wanted was the uniform delivery of what was marketed, and on the box, without being told to read that I am to commit to your ink/brand monitoring and use.  

FAR too slippery a slope for any consumer to be strong-armed into, POST PURCHASE.  

The agent, and I will assume any reader, do not find it odd that HP would supply a full Magenta cartridge for set-up, and then Blue and Yellow that are almost empty, post set-up, as HP has explained.  

Why waste SO MUCH Magenta ink if it is not needed, and why so little of the colors left to register the need to be replaced, ALMOST AS SOON AS THE BOX IS OPENED?

The agent, and HP, never OFFERED A CONSUMER FRIENDLY SOLUTION!  They told me to read HP policy - WHICH IS ASSININE OF YOUR AGENT, AND HP WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT WAY TO SERVE THE CONSUMER!!!

HP then sent me a refurbished printer with no monetary compensation. This is underhanded in my opinion. I researched and could have purchased a refurbished for less money. This speaks to the way you do business. Not that great in my opinion. Not to mention, Hp sent that refurbished to me with no ink or power cord. At no time was I informed to keep both those parts from the original. The ink cartridges couldn’t have been removed even if they had told me to keep them.

But in that short time I got no less than 4 emails stating, and demanding, that my printer be on and available to the HP company 24 hours a day. Nope. No thank you. I want a printer that prints what I need it to, when I need it to. I'm not ""rolling over"" how many pages I can print if my ink cartridge is full.

It's been almost a month now and the ink has not been delivered. If I want to print photos, I have to go to Kuaitumei! Alas! Even if there is an 11-month free trial, what's the point?

372510822,Others,negative,0.734548807144165,Hp is  advertising that you get six months of ink free with certain printer purchases. I purchased the printer with the six months free and I didn’t get all my months free they were charging me and had convinced me to purchase their paper as well. I was paying monthly fees for paper I wasn’t using and they just started charging me for the ink and my subscription was not over. They locked the ink so that I couldn’t print with it. I had to go and buy another kind of ink. After taking my money they still said that I owed them a balance. Every time I  purchase a HP printer I had to pay for the free months so I returned the printer and got my money back. I will never buy a HP printer again they are scamming people.

Keep in mind I used generic for 3 months before the printer realized it had different ink. No I go a printer and generic ink I can't use. Stayed on the phone over three hour just for them to tell me there was nothing they could do and suggested I just buy the hp ink. Never again.

This copier fit inside a desk door and I made a pull-out shelf for it to roll out on. I didn't realize that I would have to remove the paper tray and tray above it - plus the electrical cord - to push the copier back into the door. I went on your stated dimensions. 

Changing the size of a copy is ridiculous and is something I do a lot. There are other things... 

One thing I do like is the quiet mode. It stays on quiet mode!
 
The price of ink is insane. I know someone in the business and it costs you about one penny per cartridge. So, I signed up for your ""ink program"". I never received any ink. Of course I ran out, so I had to buy some quickly. I got a message that I had ""violated"" my plan. No more plan - that I paid for! Contacting Customer Service lead to zero.

I am old so I don't use the printer a lot. After about 2 weeks, I need to use it. My computer would not communicate with the printer at all, after it did the first time. I than reran the entry program and had a real hard time making it work. Computers are not my strong point and I get pissed off fast when things don't work right. Then it said I was out of ink, both weren't working. That was just after 2 weeks. So, I went down and got a new black cartridge and had what I needed copied so I could mail it out.

As I pay monthly with the HP ink scheme they won't send replacement ink until that ink is used. But as I can't get the printer to work when this is happening, I have had to buy ink cartridges off the HP website and use them. But because they aren't part of the HP ink scheme they're not recognised as official HP ink, therefore you won't send replacement ink when this has run out. This has happened 3 times now and it's quite frustrating as I've had times when I've been unable to use my printer for weeks."

This product was purchased by a member of our non-profit sports club for use by the secretary. This was meant to be a traveling printer, completely stupid with spillable ink. The former secretary did not open it and it sat in her closet for a year. I opened it and put it together. I cannot remember if it happened immediately or shortly after starting to use it, but it would error after every single page. I would have to open all the doors and unseat and reseat the color cartridge to get it to work AFTER EVERY SINGLE PAGE. I ended up paying to print at my job. I took the printer back to the clubhouse and despite being super careful spilled the reservoirs of ink and the printer went straight in the trash. It was an ABSOLUTE waste of money. Additionally, I think it was supposed to scan, but I could never make that function work."

From that point on it continued to jam. I spent over an hour on the phone with someone from home company to wipe off rollers. It printed about 5 pages and new. Jammed again.  So I have a printer that doesn’t work and cancelled my subscription and was even charged for an additional 2 months after cancellation when I specifically said i do authorize HP to charge me services not used. I have record ONE set of
Ink and paid for a printer I can’t use. When given a choice, I will not buy an HP product nor will I promote them to anyone else. 
I asked to be refunded for my printer to which I received no response but somehow you can send me bills and tell me since I cancelled I can’t use the trackable in cartridge (kind of hard to use in a dead printer)"

At first I didn’t think it would be a big deal, but all the emails from HP got to be annoying.  I live in a rural area and my internet is weak at best.

I've called for tech assistance twice.  Both sessions lasted over an hour, with the tech agent running every possible process to fix the issue.  They refused to consider the possibility that the printer was defective and just sent new black find cartridges.  The new cartridges did not help.  I've therefore paid five dollars a month for ink service for NOTHING.  I don't know how to stop the charges.  I am exasperated.  I provided this information the last time you sent a survey.

Terrible picture.  Nice text print but I have a 20 year old laser for that.  Second issue - it will not install on my 9 year old HP Pavillion.

The salesperson told me that the whole process of setting up the printer had been so streamlined that it would be easy for me. I asked her a few questions in the store to make sure that I understood exactly what to do. Two of the features that I appreciate about this printer is that it is small and extremely light in weight which makes it easy to set up any where. The whole process from unpacking to printing my first sample page was about an hour. The most difficult part was getting the printer cartridges snapped in correctly. The instructions were very simple and easy to follow. So far, I have only printed documents and photos, and, the print quality was really good. I was able to use standard paper which cuts down on the expense side. I realize that I have other capabilities that I can use. I would recommend this little printer to anyone that doesn’t have a lot of printing to do; and, someone that appreciates how easy it was to install."

After several frustrating attempts I realized that wasn't going to happen so I reluctantly purchased this Series Jet Pro 8020.  I began the setup process and ran into a problem.  I wound up on the phone for almost an hour with someone who was very nice and could help me.  At the end he set me up with a program that as I understood it would monitor my ink and supply me with ink as needed.  Unfortunately I ran out of ink and as I needed to print something I simply went to Staples and bought ink.  I noticed that I was getting notices that I was being charged small amounts for the service that was doing me no good so I called and cancelled.  I was also unhappy that I was expected to keep my printer on 24/7.  The printer is in my bedroom and it gives too much light at night.

So far I'm satisfied, but I haven't used it for printing photographs on photo paper yet -- which I intend to do soon.  As far as the ink mailing program, not sure.  My printing is rather here and there and if I happen to begin a project that requires more ink than expected, I may run out.  I do have a lot of trouble seeing the little screen on the printer due to my age (82) and eyesight.  I wish it were more visible.  I do wish age & disabilities were taken into consideration more.

372852450,Others,negative,0.9590938687324524,The printer works fine. I have always used HP printers. HOWEVER I did not know when I signed up for instant ink that HP would have remote control of my printer. That piece of information was not detailed anywhere and I also did not know I would be charged per page of printing if I went over a limit. So… I cancelled my instant ink service and HP locked down my printer so I couldn’t use it. EVEN though I had FULL ink cartridges installed that I paid for. Your ink went in the trash and I installed my own ink to free up the printer that I bought with my money. This borders on extortion plan and simple.

I can’t get replacement cartridges because they say I have only printed a few pages. But what they failed to take into account is that every time I had to get back on the printer. I had to go back through them and do a bunch of stuff and they printed five or six or seven pages every time I did this, they’re the ones that used up on my ink so I never got any free ink and my six months is almost up. I ended my relationship with inkjet and to think that they charged me every month to be a part of this! It is supposed to be free ink you’re not supposed to get charged  I tell everybody not to buy your printer because of inkjet. I don’t even know how to get them off the damn printer I’m gonna go buy my own ink cartridges and put them in and hopefully that will get rid of them. Horrible company and absolute horrible, horrible company just another example of doing nothing, and expecting to get paid , they did nothing absolutely zero for the six months that I’ve had the printer and they expect to get paid every month and if they don’t get the dollar 99 they shut my printer down. What the hell they held my printer hostage because I switched debit cards because I lost one on vacation. I was waiting on a new card so I couldn’t use my printer. I would never have bought your printer. Had I known I had to deal with inkjet if I were you I’d end my relationship with them because they never give the free ink. When my assistant saw the little printer I bought for my home office she immediately told me to remove inkjet because they would shut my printer down. I thought she was being absolutely ridiculous but guess what? They did!! Why would you give inkjet the ability to shut down a printer I flipping OWN? Didn’t see that anywhere in the product description. I love my printer it’s small lightweight does a good job and when inkjet gets tossed n the trash maybe I can get the little side jobs done at home without having to run down to the office to print. I didn’t want to run out everytime I needed to print!!! That’s why I bought a printer for home."

Consumer can leisurely flip pages & have instructions on-hand if/when needed vs needing to access phone for i instructions!

Wish i was part of that dept & test group subjects … btw, was printer available in black?

- had Hp back in the ‘90’s & liked it… over the years used above referenced multi function wifi simple & office caliber printers w/no issues! 

- feel trapped w/HP, tried this HP interested in the ink program only to discover that ink tuns out fast (worse than Canon but such waa for photo printing so u understandable) ! 
-  HP said my ink was running out so sent ink replacement carttidges but i waited almost 2 weeks for a replacenent cartidges,,,WTH when i need ink ASAP w/in a day or two like how AMAZON & WALMART+ delivers?!!

- Unless HP can deliver ink cartridges faster, can HP give vouchers on phone or paper ones when enrolling in ink program (esp when awaiting ink to print) w/options to pick up at designated locations (Office Max, Office Depot, Fisher Hawaii, collab w/Amazon local cust svce/return sites at Whole Foods & soon Amazon warehouse in Honolulu.?

My son came to help, figured out how to get messages from the printer. I learned that because my account for automatic delivery of printer ink had a problem, the printer would not print. And the printer didn’t even need ink! I updated that info. And now sometimes, it will print from my iPad, but not my Samsung phone.
I just wanted a printer that would print and this one it too difficult. I’m a retired widow and just print knit and crochet patterns and occasional receipts. The receipts I needed for taxes had to be emailed to my son and he printed them and brought them to me.

Over all, it’s a nice functional printer however there are a few things I feel could be better with it. For starters, it’s kinda difficult to set up. And don’t get me started if you end up changing your wifi password like I had to at one point. Getting the new code and trying to figure out that process took more time out of my day than I would like to admit. I would have thought the HP app would have been helpful in that situation but honestly it made it worse. It’s difficult to use. 
Additionally, the main issue I have with this printer is that the printer cartridge are expensive!! Which wouldn’t totally bother me if they didn’t run out of ink after 3 pages of printing. I even buy the XL versions which are usually more costly and thru still don’t last.

The first one stopped working. COSTCO replace it with the current one last week.

The machine itself seems OK, but your apps, programs, or whatever you call them are very confusing.

The directions you get with the printer are a joke.  They say nothing and give directions the are at best awful.  Also, if a customer calls customer service for help they get any other country other than the USA. It took 5 hours to figure out how to set up the printer and redo the ink program, which is your only redeeming qauality."

There was no screen that I can see to pick USB. Then, when using the HP smart to set up the printer, the test page was ok, but when printing documents, my papers kept being jam. I spent many hour following the HP website for clearing the paper jam, I cleaned out all the papers per instructions, but it kept on jamming. I am an older person, and not good with technology. HP should have step by step for any instruction like me. I wasted so many papers and inks on this printer, but all the instructions did not solve the problems.

The only down side is the requirement for the 3 months free ink is giving over credit card details, which loses 2 points as it's a no from me.

The cartridge that came with the printer very quickly ran out and because no new cartridges had been delivered yet, and because I still needed to do a lot of printing, I went to the store and bought another HP cartridge.  I am now continually getting messages saying that the cartridge I have installed (despite being an HP cartridge) isn't an Instant Ink cartridge and that it therefore ""can't be recognised"".  I have no idea when I will receive the new shipment of cartridges.  This is very frustrating."

Secondly because the following day when I tried to print, it would only print in black and white and not in colour - with no option to select colour.  We ended up having to uninstall and reinstall the printer.

I absolutely loathe the fact that we are chained to HP for cartridges in future.  Unfair monopoly, but of course no one will do anything about that, unless the US is successful in its recently launched lawsuit against Apple, and then your world will change.

I could not register at HP INSTANT INK, as I had no ink to print.
I went to Best BUY, the mgr. would not give me the small tester inks.
I bought a set, but he said I needed 6055e instead of 6000e.  
He gave me ink #67.  Chaos!  I need a printer,  IT IS NOT PRINTING

As a whole, in my opinion, technology has taken a step backward in terms of consumer usability and ease of setup. I have had trouble setting up other HP printer products, especially on network environments. Instead of an App to download, and a maddeningly frustrating push to sign up for monthly subscriptions no one needs, a link to an install wizard to do a step by step walkthrough including default resolution settings would be way more efficient. Even better, set up the firmware and software defaults to allow for instant ease of use out of the box instead of a maze leading to a printer manager interface so convoluted you have to switch between two programs to adjust scanner resolution. HP’s products feel like they’re set up to make customers addicted to a live chat or phone based customer service contact; and neither of these were helpful to me at all. This product is a low end, inexpensive printing solution, but I expect ease of setup and use from HP, as well as ink cartridges that don’t drain half their ink within the first 20 pages printed. I gave you a 5 because of my love of your past products, specifically the laser jet 1102 (the best black and white printer ever made). The next convoluted, frustrating, awful product I buy from HP will drop that to zero, and I will no longer tell people about good products I’ve purchased from HP in the past.

He could not solve the issue and provided me with a replacement printer the arrived within 24 hours of our discussion.  When my replacement printer arrived, I had to contact Customer Service again since there was an issue concerning my Instant Ink program.  He worked through all of the issues and got my system working.  In both cases, the HP representative was professional an answered all of my questions during the process.  My only suggestion to improving the process would have been to include more complete instructions with my replacement printer.  All I received was a small flyer telling me that I had to remove the print cartridge from my old printer and put it in my new printer.

The printer runs diagnostics on itself which makes finding out what is wrong easy to figure out how to fix the problem. I also like that it came with ink. I wish it came with more ink since its expensive and it takes a lot of ink just to print a few things but other than that I love it. You can even print directly from your phone.

I purchased the HP Officejet Pro 9025 printer. Since then, I've had to replace it twice. Once because the cartridge area jammed and I could not get it unjammed. The second time it would continue to stop printing or scanning in the middle of a job which caused me to have to start over, wasting valuable paper and ink. With this replacement, my third time with this model, it continues to give me issues: (1) repeatedly loses internet connection (all other printers in our office, a lot older than my model, don't lose internet connection; (2) stops scanning in the middle of a job as well as stops printing in the middle of a job. Then, I have to turn it off and restart it again before I can start the scanning or printing job again.

I would suggest a sticker be placed on the printer with short directions on things like how to clear a paper jam, how to check ink levels, how to power on/off when the printer seems to not be responding, how to cancel a print job.

373140773,Others,negative,0.8081989884376526,"i bought an HP ENVY 6055e based on the combination of features and sale price.  i initially installed it with no problems once i was able to get HP Smart to find the ENVY.  i already had two other HP printers on the same network and HP Smart is not the best software HP has developed.  all three printers were not recognized when initially connected to my network, but using HP123.com printer setup connected the printers after a few tries.  the printer setup process for the ENVY (and all other HP printers) is the first factor for my poor score.  after getting the ENVY connected, installed, and working properly it worked well with no problems for several months.  then i decided to enroll the ENVY in HP ink.  nothing went well from that point forward.  over a few months, ink sent by HP ink did not work, and when i tried to install my own purchased third party cartridges, they would not work.  i tried to use online help (not helpful) and finally called HP support and was told i could only use cartridges sent by HP in the ENVY while enrolled in HP ink.  i then cancelled my enrollment in HP ink.  in a few days the printer stopped working. i was unable to use HP smart to diagnose or fix the problem.  i then unplugged the printer for a few days and disconnected it from my network.  i then tried to reinstall the printer, using HP smart - did not work; HP 123 printer setup - did not work.  i could not reconnect the printer to the network and neither approach could find the printer. i finally called HP support and was guided through a process to get the printer back online which failed every time.  the second major factor for my poor score is the total lack of success in using HP 123 printer setup and HP Smart to get the printer back online and working.  the software is a major negative and i cannot recommend it.  the third major negative is HP ink. i have nothing good to say about HP ink.  i blame myself for enrolling but i blame HP for creating a system which continually downloads updates which prevent me from using purchased ink, makes the printer captive to HP control, and succeeds in making my experience  the exact opposite of what i want and expect from HP.  i have been an HP customer in my professional career since the 1980s as a CIO in both the private sector and the public sector.  HP seldom let my or my organization down.  as a consumer in my personal life, HP has repeatedly let me down.  the ENVY sits unconnected and unused in my home office because all attempts to reconnect it to my network have failed and i don't want to waste any more time with it.  I've owned more than a dozen HP printers over the past 7 years since retiring from the federal government.  the until HP ink and HP smart appeared, i had no problems and enjoyed my HP printers.  that has ended with the experiences with my last three HP printers.  i cannot and will not recommend HP printers which depend on the current use of HP smart and HP 123 for them to work, and i will badmouth HP ink to every friend and colleague i have.  three strikes and you're out."

 On the other hand, the ink is extremely economical.
 We would like a device with ink in this way but with a drawer for pages and with the option of scanning and photographing both sides of the page without our intervention.

The ink is expensive and I had a very disappointing experience using the Instant Ink service. I do not always keep my printer online and it easily loses track of usage and it is impossible to order cartridges on demand. I was very unpleasantly surprised at the financial penalties involved in discontinuing the service. When it's time to get a new printer I will consider other. brands to see whether the ink would be less expensive.

And it drinks ink (I know that's how you make money, but this is ridiculous).
I've only had HP printers (even at work) before and loved them... never again.
When I bought it I said I wanted one to replace my HP OfficeJet Pro 6978.  Well, obviously this one isn't the one.  That OfficeJet Pro was fantastic, fast, clear, used ink in a way I thought it should.  This ENVY shouldn't be used in the same breath."

Finally, HP sent me a ""new"" (refurbished) printer that came equipped with ""instant ink"" cartridges.  i couldn't use it, because I had not signed up for ""instant ink"" so I had to go out and buy new cartridges because it was going to take several days for HP to ship the right ones.  And half of them were expired!!!  On top of all this, HP offered me NOTHING in the way of compensation for the time and frustration I'd gone through.  NOTHING.  I said then that I would never buy another HP product, and I won't.  The printer still causes problems, and a few days ago I went to print something in color and apparently all the BRAND NEW cartridges have dried up.

The reason I will not buy another HP device is the greedy rip-off ink pricing. The 20% increase this year was the final straw. It is nothing but corporate greed and profiteering.

I have been an HP user for many years but now seek alternative printing options. I have slashed my print usage on the HP to an absolute minimum, which is a pity as it's easy to use. I bought a cheap alternative for the bulk of my work until I decide on a future printer, etc. Once the price increase was announced, I immediately reduced my monthly level and sought alternatives.

I closed out the HP Smart session and went through the setup using the printer’s interface/screen which worked great. 

It then tried to force me to accept the HP+ to get the free ink that I paid for by purchasing the 8028e model.  But when I read that if I cancel it, the ink cartridges that were supposed to be included would cease to work, I’d have to remove and return them, and go buy new ones!

373684476,Others,negative,0.41285306215286255,I had instant ink plan for $0.00 month for 10 pages. They changed plan to $1.49 month for 10 pages
373692901,Price,positive,0.8311150670051575,"Very happy with my new printer, it does much more than my previous (very old) HP printer and is very easy to use. I gave a slightly lower rating because I find the cost of the ink cartridges very high. They are even more expensive than my last printer's cartridges which I also found very expensive - I buy them at Staples, is there somewhere else I can get them for a more reasonable price?"
373696663,Product Quality,positive,0.8425340056419373,We have used HP printers for many years.  They have always been fabulous printers but they eventually give up.  They are wonderful printers.  Good quality & long lasting.  That is why we purchased this HP printer. We can always rely on HP.  We just wish the inks were not so expensive.
373702315,Customer Service,positive,0.8183004260063171,I liked my old HP printer but it stopped connecting to the internet which made using instant ink difficult. I really enjoy the instant ink service and not having to go out to buy cartridges. My customer service experiences have generally been pleasant and productive. I have recommended HP to others and would again.
373712464,Others,positive,0.9763377904891968,The setup was really easy and I like the ink refill option.
373725253,Others,negative,0.5777676105499268,"It was miss leading. Says that it comes with a three month supply of ink.   But you have to sign up to get it to a monthly program to get it.  And continue paying after the 3 months. Should have just been included in the box with the printer. 
Plus when I purchased the printer they had no replacement ink in the store. 
The packaging was very misleading until you actually took the time to fully read it. I wanted a cheap printer with ink and to be able to get replacement ink in the future. So now I have a printer and don’t want to sign up for a program to get the 3 months supply included. 
And clearly I may have an issue getting ink for it in the future."
373729840,Others,negative,0.8952562808990479,"Printer stopped working, after just receiving new ink which I haven’t opened yet. Got a new printer to print important documents, cancelled the old one and said I’ll still be charged one more time, when I just was charged for a new month a few days ago. Very frustrating to be nickled and dimed from big box companies. Will be on the market for a new printer after this one kicks rocks"

We bought a new hp desktop and thought we would get a good printer this time. The printer worked well then the original ink ran out as the printer became a year old. We bought hp ink and not cheeper copies. Then it has never printed well after this. The inks are installed in the right way. We now don’t use the printer and feel it was know better than a cheep printer.

Then after I get the new one there were no ink cartridges sent with it. When I finally did get some they didn't work. And finally when I couldn't stand waiting any longer for you guys to correct your mistake I went and bought my own so I could print something you guys bitched about me using them. Now the second printer from you guys is starting to fail already too with the feeder not working when I want to scan documents that longer then 2 pages. I wasn't going to mention that because i was worried how long it would take to get a new one and what else i might have to deal with from you trying to print again."

I realised after only printing a small number of sheets I wouldn’t need the subscription to keep getting new ink. I therefore cancelled it. I am now left with a printer I cannot use. What a waste of ink! When we already live  in a throw away society, it’s forcing me to remove the ink which has barely been used.. I wish I had never bought it."

373811817,Others,negative,0.8777402639389038,This is a great printer. The only reason for a lower rating is the ink is to damn expensive and the instant ink program is trash now that HP decided to no longer accept debit cards and only accept credit cards. This is total BS

I thought I could ALL unused pages over but when called to check on how many pages I carried over - was told at this time only 30 pages could be carried over - an additional charge would apply -(not happy about not being told about this when I signed up ) so I decided to cancel this plan and now will purchase ink cartridge when needed & have chive to print as many pages as needed.

Since I cancelled my subscription I have not been able to use the printer at all since 18 March. We own two HP Pavillion laptops and twoHp 600 envoy printers. We are loyal HP customers and find this experience very disappointing"

When we replaced the cartridges the problems started. The printer wouldn’t print correctly, missing colors every now and again or no printing at all. We changed the ink again only for the printer to reject them altogether. We have tried all the recommended maintenance options, but it still doesn’t work."

Then you locked me into HP ink ONLY, at 3x the price of alternatives.  I usually have bought branded ink but your prices are off the charts.  Now, you won't unlock my printer, which can easily be done via firmware or software.  Therefore, I will never buy another HP product, never recommend to family and friends, continue to provide this feedback, etc.  You have really lost me on this one."

Last year I purchased it new because the replacement from the previous one leaked black ink all over my desk countertop.

373830705,Others,negative,0.6422125101089478,"I have purchased ONLY HP printers since the late 1990's, but now I am done and will not ever buy another HP printer. This HP Envy has been nothing but problems, hours upon  hours of troubleshooting, and all it can do is make photocopies. I made the grave mistake of signing up for the auto-ink refills, that was a disaster... the account was always a mess, I had to go out and buy ink anyway because they never sent ink, but they billed me for number of copies I made, it was insane, then after discontiinuing that program, no amount of tech support can get the printer to communicate with home network anymore... without being connected to an auto-ink account, this printer is useless. I just want to be able to print things off my laptop, as I have been able to do for the past 25 years with all my other HP printers, but this seems no longer possible with HP. Hundreds of hours of frustration have gone into this piece of crap. I now warn everyone: AVOID HP."
373832232,Others,negative,0.8257790803909302,"This copier does not work most of the time when called upon to make manual copies in the instructed manner -- usually after (sometimes long after) having made copies sent from the computer.  When opening the top/lid to insert the page, it clicks if opened all the way (90 degrees).  But no matter how much it is opened, and no matter whether I press the B & W or color copy button after (or before or before and after) closing the top, no copy is forthcoming.  Sometimes the button lights up but no copy count shows on screen, and no copy.  Unplugging/replugging. seems to be the onlyl way to make it work, and that takes a bunch of time while everything has to cycle up."

I wish I could have read and downloaded a spreadsheet of features, clicked on what I wanted, then seen what was available -- INCLUDING date of first manufacture and/or likelihood of being retired soonest.  ... The Instant Ink is a whole different situation entirely.  I want a warning of when I'm approaching my # of copies per month WITHOUT having to sign into HP.  Yes, Instant Ink is handy, especially with as fast as cartridge numbers are retired and not carried in my local Staples store, but I'm not convinced it's saving me even a penny."

374138715,Others,positive,0.7674078941345215,I’ve frankly not used it all that much yet but my experience with HP overall has been good.  It was fairly easy to set up although there were some times where it wasn’t clear to me from the pictures just what was necessary to be done or I was afraid of breaking something.  Something as simple as taking the “covers” off the different color ink cartridges took longer than I felt it should have.  I’m not of the opinion that rotating the covers off is/was the best way.  I ended up using a small flathead screw driver to wiggle and pry the covers up and off.

No way to find out what's wrong with your printer and solve for yourself - the troubleshooting steps are just as simple as ""unplug it and plug it back in"" to try and fix your issue. Need to talk to someone? Nope! You gotta wait for them to get back to you on their clock, not yours. Warranty ran out? Oh well, you can't use our chat features now. Everything post-purchase is designed to force you to purchase ANOTHER printer. And you have to pay monthly for ink, even if you don't use it.

That is not adequate if one is doing large projects. Then there is my disappointment with the Instant Paper.... I will see if I can answer about THAT issue further along in this Survey. ..."

It appears it’s not the printer but the cartridges or perhaps it’s that the printer is not recognizing the cartridges. It’s very time-consuming to try and fix this and it seems to always happen when I need to print postage for mailing packages and I’m without a printer. It’s very very disappointing.

I couldn't speak to any one no matter how I tried. In the end I made the decision to replace it with a similar model. Again I tried to speak with someone to gain a recommendation. After waiting in the end I spoke with a nice German chap who recommended a replacement model however, when I typed in the model number in the UK website it was not known.  
In summary the printers work well, the automatic ink service and website are good and if were not for the difficulty of being able to speak with a human being I would have given a 10 score."

I'm not happy about the customer service though. This has been non-existent and navigating your website to register my printer for the warranty was difficult.  One night a week ago around I finally found how I could email from your website but when clicking submit it would not send. Did you receive it?  I then sent a message on FB messenger and I have still not received a reply.  
I was wanting to check the serial number of my printer was correct as it is hard to see all the numbers.
I hope to hear from you after this.

I had to hire an engineer & pay him $60 to talk to hp support with me in my home. Finally, the female representative understood that the printer was defective.
You have NO IDEA what I went through, because I needed to print & scan important legal documents to my attorney.
I should sue you for adding to the physical pain I already lived with. The reps were useless; I blame the person who trained them. They weren't even aware that the black page that printed was all over the internet, with people having the same issue.

I was anxious, stressed, in MORE physical pain. What more can I say.

I'd say to HP CEO'S to use a call center in South America.

I don't EVER want to call you again. I've used HP since 1997. But now, I have to switch because of the unbearable interactions with the useless support team.

One representative had taken over my camera & never had me watch, so I can verify he exited my  phone's camera. I felt like I was being watched, all because of a very unprofessional support from that guy. He just kept saying, "" uhm, uhm, over & over."" 

Please HP leave this team & use a different support center; one that will train their team properly & keep track of all the issues the people on Google have issues with; they may learn something & keep up with the latest issue.

I would subscribe for ink, but don't dare, for I can't go through the nightmare a 3rd time.

375231834,Others,negative,0.7219325304031372,"First of all, paying the full price for half service is ridiculous. This is a printer; it should print documents or at least make copies of them. At this point it is an over-sized paperweight. The whole ""instant Ink"" program is nothing more than a racket and a gimmick. If you guys are going to ask your customers to pay this high of a monthly fee for ink and printing (much much higher than what the printer, ink and paper would normally cost) You should at least offer customer service that could constitute for charging that high of a price. I assumed being apart of a program like this meant that customer service would be better than it normally is. Second of all, there should be no struggling to understand one another when someone calls for help. Having only foreign ""help"" makes things more difficult than they already are. I believe the guys name was Rohit, he seemed to be more interested in speaking to his ""coworkers"" in his native tongue rather than solving the printer issues I was having. He asked me multiple times to take out the cartridges and flip them to each and every side over and over and over and wipe them with a piece of paper, which I did...each and every time, and when I did, I was able to hear him mute the phone and each time (yes, there were multiple times) he came back on the line, he was laughing and would repeat the last thing he said before he muted the phone. He had to have access to my phone and my computer, not one or the other, but both. After THREE HOURS back and fourth between the phone AND computer, no progress was made with the printer, I asked for a reference number to pick the call up later because we were obviously getting nowhere and my phone was about to die and he cut me off and said ""no no no only 20 minute more only twenty minute more"" to which I replied ""look, we've been on the phone for 3 hours and nothing has changed, my phone is dying now and I need to go."" To which he responded by placing me on hold again and speaking Hindi or Gujarati or whatever language he naturally speaks to someone around him and laughing, I only know this to be the case because he accidentally unmuted his conversation to where I could actually hear him this time which only solidified what my thoughts were earlier; There is no progress due to the fact that he would rather engage in a more entertaining conversation elsewhere instead of doing his job. Everyone has days, I understand that, but this was ridiculous. THREE HOURS with no progress is absolutely unacceptable."

You have expensive printers that should last 20 years and you charge outrageous prices for ink.

375304590,Others,negative,0.40759843587875366,"The printer is great value for the money: duplex printing, scanning and copying, all in a small form factor.  The only snags are: 
1. It will only work with HP cartridges.  Even if an off-brand works today, it may not work tomorrow.
2. There is an incessant push to sign up for the cartridge replacement service.  I have already tried this on a different HP printer and did not find it useful.  A cartridge could run out as a result of a large print job and the mailed replacement does not arrive for a day or two.  Can’t really stock up.  Also, if you cancel the service the cartridges you already have will not work.  Really.
3. Stand-alone cartridges are quite expensive and don’t deliver a lot of pages.  I’m using this as a travel printer so I likely won’t be printing large runs.  But still.  I understand that the cartridge capacity is necessarily small to accommodate the printer size.  But still.

That said, it is a nice little printer.  Not quite as portable as I thought.  I used to have a Canon BJC-85 that weighed around 3 lbs whereas this is around 12 lbs.  Way different functionality.  But still"

They can clearly see how much ink I've used and printing I'm doing. Thus why I canceled 3-4 months after the free trial subscription because although I've signed up for the cheapest plan, $3.06 as suggested by HP instaInk. I'm was still paying from 6-10$ a month. Not receiving ink or paper, because the printer can detect the printer is barely being used.

Instead of being able to keep the ink I was given and the ink i had to request for, i have to return the ink and then go buy new ink.

 What?! Why?! I paid for it! Do the math.  Am I getting a refund.  No. Then why would I send back ink I paid for in the subscription.  

HP is treating people as tho they are incompetent. 

Keep in mind the printer came with ink. After 2 months I had to request the ink and paper i was supposed to received automatically.

The printer came with a 3 month free Subscription. Then in order to continue using the printer I needed an HP account which keeps u subscribed to their BS.
Had I known I would have never. 

it's a scam! I wish I never bought this printer. Waste of energy and effort. Nothing convenient about this ..

375694318,Customer Service,negative,0.9578880667686462,"It was defective from the start.  I had to make two long calls to HP Customer Service (tech support) for them to tell me what I already knew and for them to guide me through superficial “fixes,”
Which I had already performed.  Then, I was told I would have to send it back first before a replacement would be sent.  I waited a day for the shipping label and gave up on HP and took it back to Staples, which immediately exchanged it for a new one.  The new one works great.  Photo color printing is good but not great.  Then days later I got a shipping notice for a new one to be sent to me and I had to spend another 20 minutes on the phone to cancel that “order.”  Your customer service is just terrible."

375708818,Others,negative,0.6559410691261292,This printer should be wireless but only works with a USB cable.  It runs out of color ink long before black even though I print almost everything in black.  It will not work without reading the message sent via internet.  The old HP printer I purchased years ago worked well without reading the internet for instructions.  I am not sure they even make good printers anymore but I wouldn't waste my money on another HP.

I had planned to replace the printerhead but the cost was quite a bit at that time.  This printer however is very slow and the quality of printing is rated at a 5 out of 10 at best. Also the cost of ink is unreal. I joined that HP ink club which worked fine at first but has failed to send replacement ink for the black cartridge and the printer is constantly reflecting the ink is low.   I recently purchased another type of printer with ink tanks to see if it performs better than the HP Inkjet.  The company advertises that you save money on ink which is very costly with HP.

Our new printer, a 4500 series, took me a while to set up and I did have to call HP help center. Other than that it works fine and the family has learned to use it. But, the ink doesn't last long and it's costly to refill. I'm sure you've heard that before. In general, we like the printer and now our 7 year old HP PC is due to be replaced and I'm shopping around."

The got into my computer remotely and then told me I had a network worm and tried to sell me Norton Anti-virus for 3000$ to protect all my devices. I already had 2 anti-virus/malware programs running and nothing has ever shown up. So instead of using the HP Smart app I downloaded a scanner app from Microsoft store n it runs the scanner just fine. That was a joke. I am  also set up with an auto-refill for ink n paper and when the printer goes on the fritz it starts printing all kinds of info pages and wastes tons of paper and ink. Guess ill be paying for those scrap pages too."

Your person on the line was not friendly when I cancelled the service, and made me feel like an unvalued customer with her attitude.  The fact that you did this to possibly thousands of other people and ended up with a lawsuit proves to me you are no longer the HP I used my entire life (and I am 67 years old and was a fervent customer of yours).  I have made sure to warn all my friends and family of your deceptive practices. My husband and I worked over 30 years in the computer industry(IBM, EDS, HP) and swore by your product to the detriment of my own employer’s. My husband and I now swear because I spent so much money for your printer to have such a low-life practice done to me as a long-time faithful customer."

This equipment most has flashing lights and if you don’t have instructions nearby to scramble through every time you want to use a new feature (like I don’t) than your lost. I like the HP not only resolve my issues when I call but they also educate me and share about offers and services to improve my experience. I now have a subscription for insta ink because a representative first solved my issue and then presented a promotion that served the needs of my business. No haggling or forgetting why I called and most importantly had the knowledge to get my problem fixed and save me money. Perfect experience as tech support should be, especially for such an inferior product."
375771862,Others,positive,0.3844812214374542,"I’ve needed a new printer for awhile now. Was getting tired of having to turn it Off, then On to get it to connect to my Wifi Network, which happened every morning when I printed out the daily crossword puzzle. Inconvenient, you bet. 
The old printer (4500 Series) was going to need ink soon. Both black and color. 
Seen an Ad about HP Printer sale the week before and decided to upgrade. 
Bought the OfficeJet 8015e for $99 + Enviro $3 + GST of 5%. Why there is a tax on the Enviro fee, I don’t know, no one has an answer for that. 
The cost of the printer was just a few dollars more than the cost of 2 new ink cartridges for the old printer. 
Bought the HP+ which gave me 6 months of ink and an extra year of warranty. 
Quality of print is excellent. 
The feature that helped me choose this printer is the self-healing network.  No more getting out of my chair to cycle the printer Off/On, but I still need to get out of my chair to get the printed page. But at least the page has been printed by the time I get to the printer. 
Installation:  Have your HP account set up before starting. Follow the instructions provided to setup the printer (remove packaging and installing ink. Plugging it in turns it on. 
Use the HP Smart App to do the rest. Didn’t have a single issue with the install and setup. 
Remember to “stay on target.” 
P.S.  I took the 50 page a month subscription. I print 30 pages of crossword puzzles a month and a few miscellaneous other pages."

However,  when he told me to go into my app store and look in games, then go to xbox, which was priced at £50  I told him, that I wasn't continuing.  He kept telling me that it was alright and that I needed to do this in order to link everything up. Because of his accent,  I could not understand what he was talking about,  but I wasn't going to buy a game for £50, so I ended the call.  I  checked everything was working ok, by printing something off my iPad. Later, I  received an email from HP, asking me to call them about the replacement ink set up, which wasn't exactly right.

1) Blocking printing:  if one cartridge is empty or having technical issues, I am blocked from printing.  This is ridiculous and extremely annoying. At these times I have to find other locations to print while I wait for ink to arrive or spend hours with technical support, then also wait for ink or new devices to arrive.
2) Restricting ink to printer ID:  I have ink from a previous HP printer, exactly the same model, that I purchased and can't use.  What a waste and I now have to wait for ink again, and find other locations to print.

I know you're trying to FORCE your ink so you can make money and you want to prevent competition.  Good luck with this ""company focused"" product philosophy."

The two printers were polar opposites - the new Envy is easy and compact and I love it compared to frustrating experience just trying to print anything on the Canon which printed poorly in quality using 5 toner cartridges while HO is using 2 for black ink and tricolor and much easier to load paper.  Love the HP Smart App too!"

376143807,Others,positive,0.9702831506729126,I have truly enjoyed the 8028 that I had and have now purchased an 8028E model. I did this because my last one simply stopped accepting the ink cartridges. I had several cartridges on hand so rather than go to another printer I simply got the same but newer series. Frankly the features are great and the quality of print excellent. But I really wish the last one would've lasted a little longer than the 2 years or so that I had it. I don't have a business and just use it for use at home. My comment to make it a 10 would be better durability.

378873583,Others,negative,0.5720425844192505,"It's so expensive for ink so when you buy it you expect it to work. The colour ink worked, the black doesn't, i can't return this through amazon as i have used 1 of the 2 items in the box. I have been guided to the HP site to sort out my issue. This is no use at all."
378873595,Others,negative,0.4344707727432251,The black works with the previous order. It was the colors that didn't work. So I returned. Now I received a package and it's just black NO COLOR CARTRIDGES
378873620,Others,negative,0.9836112260818481,"So disappointed, I purchased this ink cartridge at the end of last year and recently needed to use it. Unfortunately the cartridge is defective and is not usable. Missed the 30 day return window and must now pay for a replacement!!!Will never purchase HP on-line again."
378873650,Product Quality,negative,0.969953179359436,This ink is of poor quality. I have used 2 in less than 4 weeks. Something is wrong with them. I have not used a ream of paper
378873652,Others,negative,0.49975648522377014,This cost 56 dollars and when I loaded the cartridge it says it can't recognize it. Know printer is ok because I load back the low ink cartridge and it works fine.Bought cartridge last January
378873669,Others,negative,0.8720552921295166,The cost is high for how long it last. Always buying yellow and have no idea why. Printing letters and numbers mostly in black. Have no idea but extremely frustrating. Doesn't last at all buying constantly at $40/pop.

378873738,Others,negative,0.9286660552024841,Installed and printed two sets of taxes on the same day and I got a notice that it was low on black ink and needed replacing. I’ve never had that happen before with ink! I’ve always had HP printers and had this one for two years! I’m very disappointed.
