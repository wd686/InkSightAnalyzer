The  young woman on the HelpDesk who got it working, was very good, patient and competend, but she too had to work had to resolve the issue - BUT now back to Square one. 
I have to ring the HelpDesk again again ...  How many hours of my life wasted that i can never get back?  Not to mention the stress ... AAAAAGGGGHHH!   
It would be great if you would take the .....thing back and refund me with interest

Turn it off again, on again, clean out the paper jam that wasn’t there, clean the ink cartridges, blah blah blah. 

Then it thought there was a paper jam when there wasn’t. But couldn’t clear the error so it was unusable for months. Again a long call to tech support. Hours of my time to fix a paper jam that didn’t exist. 

And then the ink runs out. Subscription service fails for multiple reasons… can’t locate the printer, new credit card can’t be found, old credit card expired. Tried to close the account altogether and it got stuck in internet land for a year. Couldn’t open a new one because the old one wouldn’t close. 

Tried to buy ink outside of subscription but that’s not allowed. New ink I spent $$ on doesn’t work… because I have a subscription that I can’t access because it’s stuck in cancel purgatory. It won’t cancel and yet I can’t access the account. And I can’t sign up for a new account because I already have an account. Printer dead in the water for another few months. Who has time for this?

Customer : Printer has been landfilled. Time: 4:16 PM
HP Agent : I see. What we can do is to cancel the subscription and I would like you to read the terms of cancelling: Time: 4:19 PM
HP Agent : Please be advised once we cancel your account:

1. Since Instant Ink is a postpaid plan, Cancellation requests take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will receive one final monthly charge.
2. Instant Ink cartridges will no longer work after this final month of service ends, and you will need to buy retail cartridges and replace Instant Ink cartridges to continue printing.
3. Rollover pages and free month will be lost. Time: 4:19 PM
Customer : My customer service experience with this process has been less than stellar to say the least. I couldn't buy the printer online, I had to call, once I called the service person took way too long to resolve the issue of shipping & billing addresses being different when paying with a credit card. Now this is way too complicated to just remove a printer from the plan. I feel like HP was not the best choice in this purchase. Time: 4:20 PM
HP Agent : I understand you Todd and I apologize for the inconvenience. With removing the printer in account, I will be glad to assist you with that if you wish to cancel now. Time: 4:22 PM
Customer : Yes I know that the instant ink plan is a post paid plan. The printer is GONE. I HAVE A NEW PRINTER ENROLLED IN THE PLAN. WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT? I have already enrolled the new printer in the plan. Time: 4:23 PM
HP Agent : I can check what I can further do for you, Todd. I don't intend to make this hard for you. I just want you to know the terms for cancelling the printer. I hope you understand. Time: 4:24 PM
Customer : I have like 12 windows open across the top of my screen for something that should be able to do myself from my Instant Ink account page. It's like $8.00 a month for the plan. I've wasted 10X that dealing with this. How is it that this is the Best HP can do? This process is horrible. Time: 4:26 PM
HP Agent : I realize where you are coming from, and we wanted this to be convenient for you as well. We could have just enrolled your printer as a replacement with your old printer to automatically cancel the old one. Since you enrolled, then I will assist you on cancelling the old printer that is already dead. Time: 4:30 PM
HP Agent : I can request the cancellation on my end and will ask for your phone number and last 4 digits of your card to cancel and see what we can do about the final bill. How's that sound? Time: 4:31 PM
Customer : I've wasted enough time with this. Delete the old printer [8610] from the account and leave the new printer [8025e] enrolled. HP has enough information to adjust the account for the next billing cycle. Time: 4:32 PM

HP Agent : I will be glad to assist on cancelling the old printer and you don't have to worry; I will be requesting the cancellation for you. Please allow me to check what we can do further. Time: 4:34 PM
Customer : HP can send me my ink cartridges since only trial ones are included with the printer. Time: 4:36 PM
HP Agent : The 2 options are choices, for enrollment a new printer. The option to replace the existing printer will transfer the subscription of the old printer to the new one. In case it will help in the future. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : Also, automatic ink shipment for new printer has been processed upon enrollment as well. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : Success
The account has been canceled successfully Time: 4:37 PM
Customer : Thank you. Can we finish up? I've been on here for 40 minutes now. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : That is for your old printer. Time: 4:37 PM
HP Agent : The subscription for your old printer is now on the progress of cancellation and will be effective on March 18 - the end of this billing cycle. Time: 4:39 PM
Customer : Perfect. And the new printer is enrolled? Time: 4:41 PM
HP Agent : Yes, It is enrolled. Staying in the program will send you free ink, we will automatically send you ink replenishments once your printer notifies our system that you’re already low on ink. You will also be able to save up to 50% being with the program rather than buying cartridges in the store that might cost you up to $30-80. No worries as your new printer will also receive a shipment when needed. Time: 4:42 PM
Customer : I know. That's why I put up with this terrible system. Time: 4:43 PM
Customer : Does HP have a program where I can rent the printer? Time: 4:44 PM
HP Agent : I can check on that. Does it like, you will rent a new printer from HP. Am I correct? Time: 4:45 PM
Customer : Yeah, so I don't have to buy a printer or ink. Just paper and HP looks after the rest. A service like cable TV. Broken printer no problem HP will send me a new one. Time: 4:47 PM
Customer : Now that would be worth like $10/month forever. Time: 4:47 PM
Customer : Are we done? This has been painful, like a root canal with out anesthesia. Time: 4:48 PM
HP Agent : Thank you for confirming. Please give me 2-3 minutes to check about that. Thank you. Time: 4:49 PM
HP Agent : I just wanted to know if we are still connected. Are you still there? Time: 4:52 PM
Customer : Yes. Time: 4:52 PM
HP Agent : Thank you for waiting. For the meantime, we currently don't have that kind plan. That was a great idea I guess and maybe we'll come up with this kind one day. Time: 4:53 PM
Customer : K. I'm done. Thank you you are great but the process over which you have no control really sucks. Save this chat and take it to the next Customer feedback meeting. Thank you. Goodbye. Time: 4:55 PM",0,0,1,0,0

The printer itself works fine. I believe it's our third printer in recent years. So, we consider ourselves loyal clients.

The main issue we have is with the ink. The cartridges are ridiculously expensive. But tired of receiving blocked messages for using alternative ink, we recently subscribed to your Instant Ink program. 

What a disapointment that has been. We ordered the suggested initial order and HP can't even get that right! The order was placed directly on-line through your app and 10 days later, still no sign of the order or evidence that the product has even been shipped. 

How frustrating. We tried to encourage HP and it's a total flop. I understand it's difficult to match the Amazon next day service but 10 days and still no information available. Really? Customer service didn't have any answers today. Polite, yes, but doesnt help us replenish our empty ink cartridge. And let me tell you, B&W print outs for work / client purposes, not too impressive.

We are not complainers but I received the survey email and since you asked, here's our feedback. 2/10 simply because the idea of Instant Ink is convenient. But overall, as an experience, what a failure. 

We will evaluate our options over the next day or two, then make a decision on our subscription.

Please and thank you,
Andre

I asked the lady why should I buy this printer from you for 100 dollars more than Amazon is selling it for? She said she would give me free instant ink for the life of the printer.
I agreed to buy it. 6 months later i receive a bill for 7.00 for instant ink. I have gone thought several of your team members, all of them say they will exoculate the problem.
Then I don't hear from anyone. So all I am asking for is my 100.00 dollars back that I was cheated out of. If i do not receive it buy April 12,2024, I will have my sister video tape me smashing the printer with a sledge hammer. I will put this on every social media net there is.

We wanted to go with an ink tank printer for the cost savings because you all started pricing your cartridges beyond our price range. We did a lot of research between HP and Epson and wanted to give the new HP Smart Tank first try as we like HP printers in the past.  Your website description was not very clear so we talked with the sales person and they could not find out for sure if any of the HP Smart Tank printers would do 2 sided copying and 2 sided scanning which was a must for us. We all decided to give it a try since it did 2 sided copying it may do the others and meet our needs. We get it home, hook and set it up and give it a try. It prints great but will not do the 2 sided scanning and copying and we couldn't find one of the new ink well HPs that would so it is going back as we have purchased an Epson with the ink wells that will do what we wanted.

I was busy during the first few months after buying this, so I lost a lot of free copies that didn't roll over.  Kind of rude to take away copies if you really want to keep me going forward. I lost probably 100 free copies. 
2 - VERY ANNOYED that the printer just starts making noise for no reason at all.  Sounds like it's going through a reset even though I haven't used it for a few hours. If 
I try to print as this happens, nothing prints. Has happened about 10x since getting printer. Only way to stop it is to unplug and restart.  Why? There's also times that the print job doesn't print, have to cancel and reprint.  Not good if you are printing a coupon that is a ONE TIME print.  I lost coupons due to printer not printing. 

3 - why not have words 'color' and 'black and white' on printer for copying? At first didn't know which was color copy button. Trial and error. Should have more features on the printer. 
4 - any calls into HP are very time consuming. 
5 - So far, during the free trial, I haven't yet had to replace the cartridges considering cartridges never last.  Usually cartridges in the past never last this long.

370374951,"First, the printer seems to print, and the print quality is ok.  Sadly, that was about the only thing that was ok.

However, it was frankly utterly ridiculous process getting it work that stops this being a 10.

It took me over 2 hours to get the printer working, and almost all of that was trying to get the software set up.  Filling after that with ink was reasonably easy.

1. The printer could not find my phone, and in spite of putting the phone on top of the printer, for 30 mins just kept telling me every few minutes ""Weak Bluetooth Connection"".  Apparently there was nothing I could do to change that.

2. For no apparent reason, the printer then started to talk to the phone. Why, I have no idea...

3.It refused to connect to the Wi-Fi network, and told me the password was incorrect, in spite of the password being EXACTLY correct.

4. Three attempts later, with the same password each time, it finally connected.

5.  The pictures in the setup guide of how to fill the tanks and the animated diagrams for this were individually useless, made even more so because the animated guide just jumped, and missed out, many / most of the essential steps.

6.  I managed to do the assembly and ink setup in spite of the instructions, not because of them.

7. In particular, the printhead alignment guide was worse than useless.

8. I then attempted to use HP Smart on the phone to set up an account, but mistyped one letter in my email. Fortunately I noticed this, and was told I could change this later.  On attempting to change this, having put in the correct email, it told me ""This username is not available"".  Attempting to re-imput the correct email, it told me ""You have changed your information too many times."" [Really - twice?] ""Please try again later"". 

As you can probably gather from all of the above, my setup was anything other than easy, and taking over two hours, did not inspire any confidence whatsoever.  The clearly wrong and useless error messages didn't make the experience any better.

I was thoroughly delighted when I discovered that the printer would work from the Apple print software already on both my laptop and desktop, and I certainly don't intend to have anything else to do with what I consider to be bug ridden and unreliable HP Smart software.

Sadly it doesn't end there.

The web address listed on the extended warranty flyer is wrong, and leads to a dead end.

The printheads have a one year warranty, which suggests for a printer that is ostensibly warranted for 3 years and has up to 3 years worth of ink, it might be a good idea to buy a spare of each. Sadly both the black and tricolour printheads are out of stock on the HP website.

370538889,"The printer works well.  It is fast, the prints look great and, being an all in one. it is versatile.  I love the automatic 2-sided printing and copying.  But I do have 2 issues with the printer though.  The biggest issue is the amount of color ink it uses.  I initially signed up for Instant Ink but stopped because I am not a regular enough user each month to justify it.  So, I use the regular cartridges.  I ran out of color very quickly even though I print very little color.  Nearly all I print is black and white documents.  I have printed less than 2 dozen pages with some color (not photographs) on them.  I do not understand why it uses so much color.  That is costly and a nuisance.  The second issue was with paper jams.  It was jamming quite a bit until I figured out that the paper tray holder pinches the pages too tightly from the sides when there are only a few pages left in the tray.  Once I figured that out, I made sure it had plenty of paper.  That seems to have resolved the issue.  But it shouldn't jam even if there is only 1 page left, especially since it is usually pretty difficult to clear the jam.  The reason it commonly had only a few pages in the paper tray was I was using different colors of paper on different projects so I would only load just about enough for what I was printing at the time.   Sometimes it was only 1 or 2 pages.
I do have one other issue.  That is with Instant Ink.  It sounds great but it is only good if you are fairly consistent in the number of pages you print each month.  As it is it's way too much trouble monitoring the number of pages printed trying to optimize the number of pages printed each month.  If you go over your selected amount you pay a higher price per page than your monthly rate.  It cost $1 if you go over by just 1 page.  That's ridiculous.  And going over 10 pages is $1 or 10 cents per page.  That's higher than most of the monthly plans.",0,0,1,0,0

Even though it was almost brand new? Then I didn’t print anything for about 8 months because I was so upset about the ink not working.

I wouldn't buy another HP, if I was paid. Well, maybe I'd buy it; use the money to buy ANYTHING ELSE, and throw the HP out the window, 
I think HP should be shut down, or, at the very least the entire board of directors fired, and new intelligent replacements brought in. 
Why not? EVERY purchase (hardware) has been difficult to get set-up correctly; some hardware fails, miserably within months, I had a 2 year warranty with Sams Club, that included ""In home repair"", but, HP tried to not accept it-- even with the Sam's Club rep on the phone. Several days later someone with a modicum (little) of intelligence figured out the warranty service, sent someone to replace the hard drive; despite pleading with the guy to stay, until completion, because something ALWAYS goes wrong when I'm told, ""Nothing ever goes wrong""-- it did, and he had to come back at another time. (Which delayed me getting my work done on time). 
Within 6 months THAT hard drive failed. 
So to short tell it:
1. Drivers are difficult to install.  
2. Getting a sucky-ass rep is hard enough, much less a good one. Almost impossible, actually.
3. Hardware failures.
4. Denial of services, even though it's in writing. 
5. With HP, you truly get what you pay for. More bang for your buck, but, in the end, you feel like you got shot in the head. 
6. In short, one of the single worst companies. 

Too bad, too. Prior to this millennia, HP stood behind it's product, had great customer service. An easy to find toll free number.

371257107,"I've always used HP products. My old HP all-in-one printer didn't have the ink option of instant ink program and it was using a full cartridge with just a few sheets printed because it would dry up due to lack of use. So I bought the new printer the deskjet 2700. I think. I set it up. It worked great on all three of my devices, a Chromebook, a pixel phone, and a Windows 10 computer.

When I printed a few copies successfully, a few minutes later the printer went off line yet the little blue light that says it's online was still on and it was still connected to the internet. According to my information from Xfinity doing a live connection test when I couldn't connect it and when the printer.couldn't connect it, none of my devices could connect.

I talked to several agents after 2 days of doing virtual support options that didn't lead anywhere. After hours of tech support failing I was scheduled a call back from a product specialist. That callback never came. So I called in. Got another call back that call back. Never came. Then I talked to support. They said that the printer had to be bad so I returned the printer. I was told it would be safe to order the same printer so I ordered the all-in-one 2700 desk yet again when it came i set it up successfully in a few minutes and it printed fine and I was happy but after less than 30 minutes it was offline and none of my devices could connect to it again. My router had a strong connection and was 1 ft away. One gigabyte router. My internet showed an excellent connection.

My internet has been rock solid for the last several years. I don't have any problems with any other devices and from what I can see I don't have any trouble connecting to the printer from the router. After the printer is gone off to sleep several minutes after that it goes offline to my devices but not offline to the internet yet. I get several emails from this printer and the last from HP saying it's my responsibility to keep an ongoing internet connection when I'm finding it in possible to do.

So I called support hopefully for the last time. Told him the story wasted everybody's time didn't mean to. The support agent suggested that a product specialist call me for the third time. I still haven't received that call. It's been 2 days now so am going to wait a couple more days and then I'm going to return it and I'm going to have to buy another brand I'm afraid. I would really like it if HP would read this and come through and offer some support because I would help him solve it if it was a bug I've had many years at in technical support myself. So I understand the challenge that this gives you and me because from what I read, there's a whole bunch of people that purchased this in the last month and what percentage of them are having this problem. If it's a hardware problem, I'd like to help resolve it. If not, I'd like to get another printer and if HP offers me a different brand that's similar. I would be excited to try something different. This is taken hours. Maybe 40 hours my time so far and haven't given up yet. Thanks for listening. Bye",0,0,1,0,0

It never arrived, and I needed a printer, so I went down to Staples on 2/22/24 and bought one.  It wouldn't set up because of a leaky ink cartridge (cyan).  Staples replaced the printer, after much fuss with their technical support.  This printer set up but kept jamming and tearing paper during the paper picking process.

371304537,"It is absolutely ridiculous that a small mistake in the set up - putting blue ink in the Black ink tank, can mean that one has to go out and buy a new printer. There is no work around or easy repair. This is a design error and makes one very nervous about buying the product. Judging from the internet, I am not the only one, in a ""senior moment"" to make this error. The instructions need to be very clear at the stage and warn people that they will be buying a new printer if they make a mistake here.

The set up program - i.e. registering first as an HP customer was terrible. I gave it 1/10. I ended up in so many dead ends. Having had an HP before, I didn't know if I was already registered. Apparently, I wasn't. At the end of the registration process there was no link back to the set up program. I tried the other HP tab on my computer and it just told me to go to such and such. Again, NO link provided. I went round and round in circles getting no where. Finally I went back to the Windows store t reload the software. It told me I already had it and offered to open it for me. Then I saw the button I needed and the actual set up program was quite good, but lacks sufficient warning on the ink issue. I am told that Epson has a design that prevents you emptying the wrong ink into the tank.
The when I was asked what I would like to do to lose the case I asked for a replacement printer at cost price. All I was offered was the next model down at 18% off. I bought my original printer at 40% off and I was able to find my printer retail at a much cheaper price than you were offering on a cheaper printer!

1. For printer 1 I opted for the subscription. You urged me several times to keep the printer on in order to keep track of the ink levels. 
The results were unacceptable flaws in the print quality. My suspicion was that keeping it on might lead to drying up of the print heads. 
When I keep the printer off when I don't have anything to print, the print quality is better. 
2. I cancelled the subscription a few weeks ago because I don't print that much but need the scanner much more. Then I needed to print a document urgently, and was surprised that the cartridges were not working any more - because of the cancelled subscription.
I had no choice than to install a new printer in a hurry, one we got with the new PC for my wife some months ago. 
3. I understand your policy to sell as many cartridges as possible. But you don't explain the nature of the first batch of cartridges and its limitations for the customer. 
4. I don't come back to my bad experience with your online support, when several customer service officers from India, all told me different stories about the problem.  Fortunately, one of them hinted at a way to solve it myself after hours of fiddling. 
5. For many years I have been a satisfied and faithful customer of HP, but the last months have been frustrating. I had already calculated to switch to Appel, but waited because of the cost.

Also, I have to bow down to you regarding ink and enter into a business arrangement where I will not have help with my machine if I do not get ink only from you.  Also, in getting ink directly from you, I have to keep track of how much I am printing to know what plan to buy without falling short of getting ink if I need it sooner than i had expected or paying for a large plan and not get all the ink I paid for if I had a slack time printing.

I had a canon Pixma and was difficult and the ink failed and was complicated to fix. The office supply man told me they do not fix this problem.
The only negative is I bought at Apple store and when I got home found out there was no ink and that is when I found I had to apply for it over the web and it counts the pages you use to see how much ink ypu have used.
I use the printer very little and am not sure I will enjoy this procedure and may end up paying more in the long run. This will totally and continually make me upset.

Sadly, we are disappointed.
1. The main issue is that there is no way to know what is happening.  I get messages occasionally saying it is in an ""Error state"" but there is no clue as to what is wrong.
2. Over the weekend I was printing a small run of pictures.  The colour cartridge ran out and there was no indication that it was running low - no error message.
3. The lights on it are quite bright.  The printer is in a bedroom and is too bright to be left on but we are told to keep the printer on all the time.
4. Why is the on off switch in such an awkward place - I presume it is to encourage us to keep the printer on but that is not going to be practical for us.
5. Sometimes when I go to print something it tells me the printer is offline when it isn't.  I have to wait for about 3 or 4 minutes and it will eventually print.

-  WHERE’S THE HARD COPY MANUAL? Esp w/this printer having THE MOST DIFFICULT INSTRUCTIONS/TRICKS to do for simple functions,  shows LAZINESS/HALF-ASS & TOO CHEAP, TOTAL DISREGARD & DISRESPECT  FOR CONSUMER TO EASILY INCLUDE a hardcopy in the box OR OPTION TO REQUEST A COMPLIMENTARY COPY OF SAME when registering the printer?  Consumer can leisurely flip pages & have instructions on-hand if/when needed vs needing to access phone for i instructions!  

TIMES HAVE CHANGED, Does HP have a quality control/consumer-industrial psychology-testing dept w/a diverse spectrum of subjects to test/review products BEFORE & AFTER bugs/cons are fixed, product finalized, and PRIOR TO mass producing/distributing same? 

Wish i was part of that dept & test group subjects … btw, was printer available in black? 

IF TOO DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE a HARD VOPY MANUAL, what about making a big cheat sheet to adhere on backside of paper tray with quick fixes, frequently used functions instructions, website for the manual orTECH HELP contact info. with QR code AND TECH HELP DESK TEL NUMBER?!!   

- used printer maybe 2x? What a waste of $, time. No wonder it was a bargain. You get what u pay for … 

- I HATE IT! I WANT TO RETURN/TRASH IT & get an easier to set-up/use EPSON, BROTHER or even CANON!

- WTH?!! can’t even make simple copies like other printers where one can just turn on, press black circle icon for B&W copy or colored circle for color printed vopy!! 

- had Hp back in the ‘90’s & liked it… over the years used above referenced multi function wifi simple & office caliber printers w/no issues! 

- feel trapped w/HP, tried this HP interested in the ink program only to discover that ink tuns out fast (worse than Canon but such waa for photo printing so u understandable) ! 
-  HP said my ink was running out so sent ink replacement carttidges but i waited almost 2 weeks for a replacenent cartidges,,,WTH when i need ink ASAP w/in a day or two like how AMAZON & WALMART+ delivers?!!

- Unless HP can deliver ink cartridges faster, can HP give vouchers on phone or paper ones when enrolling in ink program (esp when awaiting ink to print) w/options to pick up at designated locations (Office Max, Office Depot, Fisher Hawaii, collab w/Amazon local cust svce/return sites at Whole Foods & soon Amazon warehouse in Honolulu.?

HP seldom let my or my organization down.  as a consumer in my personal life, HP has repeatedly let me down.  the ENVY sits unconnected and unused in my home office because all attempts to reconnect it to my network have failed and i don't want to waste any more time with it.  I've owned more than a dozen HP printers over the past 7 years since retiring from the federal government.  the until HP ink and HP smart appeared, i had no problems and enjoyed my HP printers.  that has ended with the experiences with my last three HP printers.  i cannot and will not recommend HP printers which depend on the current use of HP smart and HP 123 for them to work, and i will badmouth HP ink to every friend and colleague i have.  three strikes and you're out.",1,0,0,0,1

The packaging was very misleading until you actually took the time to fully read it. I wanted a cheap printer with ink and to be able to get replacement ink in the future. So now I have a printer and don’t want to sign up for a program to get the 3 months supply included.

I should sue you for adding to the physical pain I already lived with. The reps were useless; I blame the person who trained them. They weren't even aware that the black page that printed was all over the internet, with people having the same issue.

I was anxious, stressed, in MORE physical pain. What more can I say.

I'd say to HP CEO'S to use a call center in South America.

I don't EVER want to call you again. I've used HP since 1997. But now, I have to switch because of the unbearable interactions with the useless support team.

One representative had taken over my camera & never had me watch, so I can verify he exited my  phone's camera. I felt like I was being watched, all because of a very unprofessional support from that guy. He just kept saying, "" uhm, uhm, over & over."" 

Please HP leave this team & use a different support center; one that will train their team properly & keep track of all the issues the people on Google have issues with; they may learn something & keep up with the latest issue.

At this point it is an over-sized paperweight. The whole ""instant Ink"" program is nothing more than a racket and a gimmick. If you guys are going to ask your customers to pay this high of a monthly fee for ink and printing (much much higher than what the printer, ink and paper would normally cost) You should at least offer customer service that could constitute for charging that high of a price. I assumed being apart of a program like this meant that customer service would be better than it normally is. Second of all, there should be no struggling to understand one another when someone calls for help. Having only foreign ""help"" makes things more difficult than they already are. I believe the guys name was Rohit, he seemed to be more interested in speaking to his ""coworkers"" in his native tongue rather than solving the printer issues I was having. He asked me multiple times to take out the cartridges and flip them to each and every side over and over and over and wipe them with a piece of paper, which I did...each and every time, and when I did, I was able to hear him mute the phone and each time (yes, there were multiple times) he came back on the line, he was laughing and would repeat the last thing he said before he muted the phone. He had to have access to my phone and my computer, not one or the other, but both. After THREE HOURS back and fourth between the phone AND computer, no progress was made with the printer, I asked for a reference number to pick the call up later because we were obviously getting nowhere and my phone was about to die and he cut me off and said ""no no no only 20 minute more only twenty minute more"" to which I replied ""look, we've been on the phone for 3 hours and nothing has changed, my phone is dying now and I need to go."" To which he responded by placing me on hold again and speaking Hindi or Gujarati or whatever language he naturally speaks to someone around him and laughing, I only know this to be the case because he accidentally unmuted his conversation to where I could actually hear him this time which only solidified what my thoughts were earlier; There is no progress due to the fact that he would rather engage in a more entertaining conversation elsewhere instead of doing his job.

They can clearly see how much ink I've used and printing I'm doing. Thus why I canceled 3-4 months after the free trial subscription because although I've signed up for the cheapest plan, $3.06 as suggested by HP instaInk. I'm was still paying from 6-10$ a month. Not receiving ink or paper, because the printer can detect the printer is barely being used.

Instead of being able to keep the ink I was given and the ink i had to request for, i have to return the ink and then go buy new ink.

 What?! Why?! I paid for it! Do the math.  Am I getting a refund.  No. Then why would I send back ink I paid for in the subscription.  

HP is treating people as tho they are incompetent. 

Keep in mind the printer came with ink. After 2 months I had to request the ink and paper i was supposed to received automatically.

The printer came with a 3 month free Subscription. Then in order to continue using the printer I needed an HP account which keeps u subscribed to their BS.

it's a scam! I wish I never bought this printer. Waste of energy and effort. Nothing convenient about this ..

The old printer (4500 Series) was going to need ink soon. Both black and color. 
Seen an Ad about HP Printer sale the week before and decided to upgrade. 
Bought the OfficeJet 8015e for $99 + Enviro $3 + GST of 5%. Why there is a tax on the Enviro fee, I don’t know, no one has an answer for that. 
The cost of the printer was just a few dollars more than the cost of 2 new ink cartridges for the old printer. 
Bought the HP+ which gave me 6 months of ink and an extra year of warranty. 
Quality of print is excellent. 
The feature that helped me choose this printer is the self-healing network.  No more getting out of my chair to cycle the printer Off/On, but I still need to get out of my chair to get the printed page. But at least the page has been printed by the time I get to the printer. 
Installation:  Have your HP account set up before starting. Follow the instructions provided to setup the printer (remove packaging and installing ink. Plugging it in turns it on. 
Use the HP Smart App to do the rest. Didn’t have a single issue with the install and setup. 
Remember to “stay on target.”

2) Restricting ink to printer ID:  I have ink from a previous HP printer, exactly the same model, that I purchased and can't use.  What a waste and I now have to wait for ink again, and find other locations to print.
