Unfortunately when I changed to a 10 page plan (because 1) i  was away from home for a significant amount of time and 2) the printer was not working for some time, then randomly started working again) I found out the # of unused pages would reset, meaning I paid for ink for MONTHS without using it, only to find out that I would lose all my unused pages once I switched my plan. To add insult to injury, you have increased my 10 page plan by ~30% which is insane. I wasted a ton of money on ink I never used

 If I give a rating of 8, it's because I have always been satisfied with your products, good quality and functionality, however there is a small hiccup with the wifi. I have a desktop computer and a laptop, but there is always a problem between the two, probably because I don't understand anything about the configuration, not to mention that you have to connect to your site and that's it. wastes time, adding codes again and again, so I struggle to print from one or the other, having to turn the printer off and on again.
 The other dark point is your printer which constantly tells me that the ink cartridges are ""pirated"" when they are reused cartridges validated by your services, it would be good if they were recognized as such. Not everyone can afford to pay so much for new ink cartridges from the manufacturer, whereas we must save resources and the ordinary citizen does not receive crazy emoluments...
 Best wishes to you",IPH,167,2024-01-02 00:50:41,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Others,negative comment

Going to the store and buying ink is way beyond the budget of an average working family just to be able to print something once every few months. Whats the point of buying a printer if the company is just going to lock you out of using the ink if you cant pay? There is no financially stable choice in any of the options HP offers. It doesn't help anyone who cant make monthly payments.

 Perfect first use. When I wanted to print some documents the next time, no color worked, only black printing. I bought a color cartridge, correct printing and again... Anyway a few months pass, need to print documents for my mother, repeat black printing and for color there is only blue!

Most of the time, it just continuously feeds the paper through instead of printing on it while letting me know there is an error.  It does not matter if you adjust the paper setting on the printer on in the printing app.  We had to buy a secondary printer (Canon) to ensure that, when we have projects, we can print photos without it taking all night to fool the printer into recognizing the paper. 

I signed up for Instant Ink.  I thought this would be a great time and money saver.  However, my printer is no longer recognized by Instant Ink so I have to call to get my ink shipped anyway.

I should add that I am aged 86 years and suffer from Parkinsons decease so I use my printer less and less as the months roll bye.

 a score of 5/10 to signify a certain number of shortcomings of the Envy 6000 device:

 - the subscription price for the ink cartridge service is not automatically adaptive, ie, does not take into account actual ink consumption, resulting in excessive billing,
 - the printing quality is poor: despite monitoring the ink level, it seems that the instruction is not sufficiently precise, since the application does not indicate a cartridge change, even though the ink level is too low to ensure visible printing of the characters on the paper,
 - loss of WiFi connection leads to a repetitive resynchronization process with failures, even after restarting the box, the PC, the printer.

This printer is very user friendly as the display screen walks you through each step on the set up process. I was a bit skeptical about the liquid ink filling process. However, this process was mess free and fast! Not one bit of ink dripped as the ink tanks were designed with this mess free concept where the tanks include caps that easily lift up and the ink does not disperse until the bottles are pushed in and you hear a click. Another great feature that was needed was good wireless connectivity. My office is far from the router which caused my other printer to not be able to reach the internet without a strong signal. This printer has no problem with that and now I can hide my printer next to my desk instead of having it on the other side of the room where a stronger router signal is.

Fortunately, I had a few of my own on hand because of how badly the subscription service worked. All that wasted ink. Obscene!
2) Poorly and cheaply made machine! The tray made for receiving printed documents is poorly designed and does not fit the paper. The scanner tray is awkwardly and poorly positioned for how a document is supposed to be placed on it.

I have two printers which I've tried to keep registered on HP smart although the 7740 is not eligible for the instant ink program so the support team is reluctant to discuss it or the system to keep it on the site.  The second is the 8025e which checks all the boxes registered/listed and in the instant ink program.

I bought my sister a HP 8034 for her birthday in March of last year and though we've tried several times throughout the year the two account are still connected and info misaligned.  My credit card is tied to the account with the 8034 and her profile linked to the account with my 8025e and I added again last week (?) but haven't checked to see if it's still on there.

We do minimal scanning and copying.  Printer has traveled from NJ to CO to NJ and fared well.  Quality of print is excellent.  Only possible issue is with heavy ink printing, paper will sometimes wrinkle, but not a deal breaker.  We really like to instant ink feature.  Instant paper is another issue, seems we get too much paper and as such have cancelled paper until further notice.  There have been a couple of glitches with the printer.  The major issue was the printer was continuing to print over and over the same job.  Had to call for this to be resolved.  Another issue is message 'printer needs attention', when there seems to be no problem with the priinter.  x-ing out of the screen takes multiple tries.",IIC,133,2024-01-08 13:22:59,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Cartridge Problem,positive comment

     #2. cannot do fax without using a computer (older models have this function without computer)  
   I have a old model from 2000 and just need to get a new color cartridge and I use this with my desktop computer with a usb/computer cord?  Hp 9600 all in one.  Does great pictures from a card (old school) this was the best fax-scanner all in one printer ever - Before WiFi.
  The printers these days are not what I want or need. I am not technically advanced so I tend to have more problems. 
This printer does print nice pages. The cartridges go far. It is an ok printer for me to just print from the internet or copy color or B&W pages. Just not for what I wanted to do.",IPH,177,2024-01-07 18:34:55,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Print quality,negative comment

Bought an 8028 only because I just invested $100+ in new ink cartridges.
2) The printer would inexplicably go offline, requiring a power cycle to get it back.
3) Whenever I need a quick print job, the printer would do self-maintenance first.  Regular maintenance checks during off hours would be better.
4) After adding the printer to the network manually using the IP address method, the printer would assign itself a new ""port"" and drop the IP address, causing me to go look for it.
5) The 8028 is brand new, so I don't know if 2, 3, & 4 will apply yet, but hoping for the best.  The 8028 feedback tone is very tinny sounding (like a blown speaker), and the plastic looks & feels even cheaper than the 8025.

My printer will not print anything the color ink is out and the black is not working either. In reality I have a printer that's useless to me. I am an artist and I love to draw pictures to give patients at the cancer center where I am a patient myself. I can't do that because my printer is not working.

 I have been using HP Instant ink for a long time (I have changed 2 printers, this is the third. I had to ""throw away"" the two previous Officejet 6950s because in both the blue - Cyano - head was blocked and no longer prints. I have also used the release fluids ... but nothing to do the blue starts to limp and then stops)

 I think you should improve and facilitate the conditions for changing printers, for example by not preventing the use of residual dedicated cartridges when you discard the printer... it's a real waste to throw away the cartridges when I could run out of them by using them within their limits - in my case without the blue - until the small supply that has been created over the years of HP Instant Ink runs out

 To set up a Wi-Fi network, I even purchased new cartridges and also a ‚Ç¨10 pack of ""INSTANT INK smart cartridges"" that were supposed to be redeemed in a payment for my subscription. But it has not been that way.
 I even had to bring a computer technician to see if I didn't know how to install it to work with USB, but it wasn't possible.
 So, bored, I unsubscribe from the monthly subscription of 10 pages per month that
 had subscribed. I have not received any cartridges yet.

If I stop paying for ink you turn off my printer. The $4.22 per month is WAY over the cost of ink if I bought it myself. So, you have me trapped until I find a way of turning off your service and buy my own ink.

Or HP can charge less per month based on my past usage and send the ink when I need it. I have just 1 color left to refill and I will have no back up. If I have to call this time I will find a way of turning off your service.

The ink cartridges were quite different than others I've used, and it was not clear at first when they were firmly in place. There's not a click or anything that indicates they are where they need to be, and there is a spring release so if you push the cartridge again, it actually releases the cartridge, rather than making sure it's in, but you can't necessarily tell that, since it doesn't always move. Once the cartridge door is closed, it say cartridges are missing or not installed properly. Since the brief instructions page didn't discuss any of this, it took a few tries to figure out.

 I couldn't be helped with my problem.

 Several times the chat was canceled because I didn't respond within a few hours. I had to describe the problem again several times and kept getting the same questions (name, model number, etc.).

 I never had the impression that anyone really wanted to help me, but instead just wanted to quickly go through routines and give standard answers.

 E.g:
 I stated that I had already changed the cartridge as a way to solve the problem. The solution that was suggested to me was to change the cartridge.

 I actually tried a few things to solve the problem (blue prints incompletely) but nothing solved the problem. The fact that the carriage for the cartridges cannot be removed makes easy repairs impossible.

HP is aware of this, I'm sure, and continues to keep raising the price of cartridges slowly but steadily, as they are aware they have a 'captive group of customers,  This thought alone could possibly cause me to rethink brands if and when it's time to replace the 9015.

 2) because it is not easy to operate with the issue of the applications that you have to have, the things that you have to update, in my case for example sometimes I print under the name hp0ff870 and sometimes under hp printing (an option that almost never works ), because it finds the printer ""disconnected"".
 3) when I print on glossy photographic paper, a layer of black powder remains, which when passed with the finger erases the print and is almost colorless. To solve it, I am supposed to find the injector option and regulate the ink issue, since this happens to many people, but I don't find those options with the system they have, I insist that the issue of more advanced configurations is not friendly.
 It works well for me anyway, on matte paper and other non-glossy papers it works well.

In fact, I had a warranty exchange as these broke.  I cringe every time I raise the top knowing that the next repair is on me. 2) The printer frequently goes to la la land and I have to pull the power cord to reset it.  3) The PC application is very hard to use and lacks important features.  4) The printer should be able to double side scan - but I knew that when I bought it.  5) The controls at the printer are minimal and insufficient.

2. NO direct printing - anytime you want to print, instead of selecting a printer and clicking ""Print"", you have to go through the ""HP Smart"" app (Not so smart), which takes a while to load, select the printer you want to use and wait for it to check its status. then when you finally allowed to click the ""Print"" button, you have to wait some more as the print job is created and sent in. 
3. the dumb ""HP smart"" is very limited and does not allow you all the options previous HP software used to.
4. Want to check your ink levels? as soon as you click on that, you are being sent online to log into your ""Account"". which doesn't always work.

But we like it enough I purchased another one for a second home, however we have not set it up there yet - lol, because of the difficulty getting this one set up initially.  The main sticking points have been 1) the HP Smart application ALWAYS shows the paper is low, no matter what.  The tray can be completely full & that notification is always present in HP Smart.  Also, I have never received an Instant Ink refill - maybe my ink levels are legitimately still very high as we don't use the printer all that much, but it's hard for me to believe that after all this time the ink supply is still as high as the HP Smart application indicates that it is.

I've had to reset or hassle with it several times to keep it functioning. Thankfully, I've been able to figure it out... Why doesn't someone put a general ""Reset"" button on these things rather than upsetting everything surrounding the printer to unplug it? A power kill button with a time delay reconnection...

Right now, after more than six months, my computer is still searching for my old HP-8600 printer and everytime I turn it on it reminds me that it can't find it. I've exhausted my limited ability to tell the computer it's gone, stop looking; anyone want to tell me how?

FWIW - I don't believe for a moment there was anything wrong with the HP8600, I just lost a great printer because repair estimates for a printer that worked fine until the day it just stopped far exceeded the replacement cost of the fairly adequate machine I have now.

The printer never printed envelopes or labels.
Since the 1st replacement cartridges, printing never lined up.
Changed wifi and was unable to connect to the printer.
Plugged in printing skipped lines and didn't print lines at the bottom of the page.
Purchased new laptop, still unable to connect to printer on wifi.
Finally (1 year later) got printer set up on wifi and printed one document from phone, but printer didn't print the last lines on the page (on inch from bottom, so not too close to the edge). After the one document, unable to print from phone.
On wifi with laptop, B&W test page printed well; color very light despite cartridge over half full; unable to print any documents.
Once connected to wifi, the laptop was unable to print with plugged in printing.
Note: I tried every HP help; internet help; reinstallation, etc. HP help was useless; troubleshooting was useless; the printer is useless.

Firmware is seriously rotten and unstable, upgrading impossible, and ALL owners has same problem, and HP will not acknowledge this as a problem. Shame on you.
Scanner software is sluggish and takes long time to use. Printing is ok for office use, but still it cannot handle moisture. Pictures is terrible, worse than other 4-ink printers.
Miserable lid hinges solution. Why is the lid not possible to lock in open position, and why no dampening? It's a heavy lid. Lid for ink is dampened and will stay at open. Very odd.

Those kind of sales tactics are horrendous. It would be one thing if you were made aware of the fact before purchasing but instead you use deceptive measures to hide it, leaving customers stuck having to by your way overpriced ink cartridge replacements.
When a company has to use techniques like this, they are blatantly admitting they are fully aware of what they are doing and doing it in a deceitful way. From what I have read so far about the laws surrounding this topic I am amazed you haven‚Äôt had a lawsuit yet.

 Not sure if your ink is 3 years old or whether that's just the way it prints.
All and all - your printer sucks big time.

 1. Easy maintenance: In inkjet printers, it is common for the inkjet head to be plugged. HP can replace the inkjet head by itself. This design is rare and suitable for home use.
 2. Rich product categories: At different price levels, the functional distinction and performance distinction are relatively obvious, making it easier for consumers to choose.
 3. The appearance design is relatively beautiful.
 shortcoming:
 1. High-end paper cannot be printed. For example, the maximum paper size is only 180g.
 2. There are few layout functions on the mobile phone software and no memory function for printing settings.
 3. The official flagship store activities are too stingy and even a bit uncomfortable.

2.  The printer is supposed to print out some of the instructions...but yet again...I have dried out cartridges that are 100% full, so NOTHING prints and I'm throwing away another cartridge.
3.  I have MULTIPLE cartridges unused at home but I can't use them unless I sign up again for a monthly fee.  So you already charged me for two years and you won't let me use the flipping cartridges I already paid for unless I sign up again.  What a flipping scam.  
-Refund me for the dried up cartridges sitting at 100% full.  
-Let me use them if I already paid for them.

Then that subscription increased. So I began to seek a solution. I saw shak on TV advertising a smart tank printer. I like hp so I checked over hp and they had one too. Finding the least one on sale for 149 was doable. It would pay for itself in a year and if the ink last 2 years as advertised then I'm actually ahead.

1. Your central system failed to note that one of my ink cartridges had run out. This required a WhatsApp conversation with one of your European agents (8th November 2023, case no. 5114575267) which indicated there was an error (RPL?? error) on my account details that you hold which had prevented sending me a new cartridge. Your WhatsApp agent was very helpful, but my point would be the error shouldn't have occurred in the first place, and had entailed quite of bit of hassle and time to discover how to make contact with you, and then to rectify the issue.
2. On the odd occasion when a print goes wrong, the unit takes a bit of time to re-set and resume functioning properly. Normally this entails switching it off/closing it down and then re-starting it again. This is an annoyance, especially if it occurs when in a hurry.

Then I got a message that because I canceled, I would have to jump through hoops to get it done.  I tried ... I really did ... even called and talked to one of your service techs.
Then i decided to take my printer back to Office Depot ... where i have purchased at least 5 printers there.  I haven't yet.
So, I am printer-less ... and need to print out some important paperwork.

But now, I may never buy another one. Setup was not easy requiring the use of HP software. When I bought new ink cartridges, it was $95 for the 2 (XL). That's 50% more than the cost of the printer!

My other HP printer is an Envy 4500. In the past I occasionally used less expensive non-HP ink with no problem. Now I get a light on the printer console saying ""non-HP cartridge"" and the printer will not work!  That's an outrage!

In the end, none of the suggestions worked and I was left with a hardly used machine that would not power up and a string of emails asking me to connect my printer to my laptop. I asked for advice at Currys who advised me to ditch the 3580 and purchase a new printer which I have done. As I am already part of the HP Smart Print deal (which I'm not complaining about) I went for another HP Printer, a more basic one which I hoped would be simpler to use and more reliable.

Question, if I'm paying for instant ink and I receive those cartridges from HP - I legally own those cartridges. As I have just found out, when I cancelled my instant ink subscription, I am unable to use the cartridges that I paid for and own. This aspect of the Instant Ink plan is a bait and switch for your customers which essentially takes away my ability to use products that I have purchased from your company. Otherwise, this plan represents a ""lease"" contract vehicle for the customer which should offer me the ability to return the cartridges for reimbursement for the product, which I am no longer using by terminating my ""subscription"" AKA lease. This plan reinforces the fears and exasperations of consumers experiencing continued issues with ink cartridges in printers. HP, by not allowing me to use my own instant ink cartridges, has violated my rights as a consumer and is literally keeping holding me hostage from me using my HP product without warning. I am completely unhappy with HP, this plan and intend to follow up on its legality as it relates to the consumer.

Forcing you to enter an app before scanning a document is beyond ridiculous.  

Your CEO: ""Our objective is to make printing as easy as possible, and our long-term objective is to make printing a subscription."" This is a total joke. You have made use of your printers so difficult, I will never own one again, much less pay a ‚Äúsubscription.‚Äù

Force feeding you ads for ridiculously overpriced ink is stupid interference.

Gee, let‚Äôs make printing as hard as possible in order to get them to buy more? It‚Äôs a heck of a strategy. I guess you guys skipped the class on customer satisfaction. Not to mention the basic premise that if you make customers really mad they won‚Äôt be customers for long. 

I guess I am one of your thousands of ex-customers who were a bad investment.

This is a pretty stupid policy and I am hardly the only one with this problem. 

First, your printer comes with toner. If you start your Instant Ink program the day you purchase a printer, it comes with new toner cartridges. These were part of what I paid for. At the end of the program, if I have to return the toner cartridges, I am getting screwed out of the cartridges that came with the machine. 

Next, besides that fact, when you find out by surprise that the cartridges no longer work, it REALLY pisses you off. Do you really want to create such bad animosity with HP?

 Then the technical service in sell-sell-sell mode. Is this part of the plan for the problem of ridiculous capacity cartridges?
 I am very dissatisfied with this printer and its interface; I don't know why they insist on complicating everything more every time they change the appearance. Do they test before? Do they consult the experience of expert customers before launching them?

It gradually stopped printing,  first print quality diminished followed by no printing at all. Running through the print head procedure, several times didn't help anything. The 7858 was similar to the HP printer I had prior to it. In that case I purchased new HP ink cartridges thinking they'd gone bad as I  don't typically print very much but that didn't help so I was out that money too.

As a result, I downgraded in the quality of printer for only about 30% more than the new cartridges would have been for the 7858 and purchased this 6052. I guess it's just the norm to have to spend $100 - 150 on a new printer every 3 - 4 years regardless of the amount of printing that it's done.

The ink is difficult to insert and click in place.

Your company wanted to put me on a replenishing plan. I had no way of knowing how you would measure the amount I used?

 Never received an answer. When I bought the printer I purchased the  HP ink. I had to buy HP ink from another supplier because HP wasn't replying to me.   

I needed to order again from HP because when i called no one seemed to know what I was asking for when I said replenishment.

Can we please talk or communicate.  705 920 1500 or Rlegault19@hotmail.com. 
Please do not sell this email address to no one.

Was a good deal I guess. Like a discount diamond is a great deal because De Beers has most of them locked in a safe somewhere to keep their prices high. Who knows if this review will be even valid by the time its posted. Most likely HP will create a mirror copy of the same printer that will use different cartridges so this one will be deprecated. Sometimes I just throw the printer away when the ink is done and buy a new one. Its usually only about $10 more and you don't have to deal with buying the wrong cartridge three times before you get the right one.

Absolutely NO, I would not recommend this HP 8025 Printer to anyone. The ink consumption is horrendous. This printer cost me $169.00. The last two ink cartridge packages (Black, Red, Blue and Yellow) cost me over $90.00 each. The last ink package I just purchased and installed on Jan 23, 2024 lasted all of one day before the color ink cartridges are now already half empty. HALF empty.... and I didn't even print any color pages. All I did was use the HP installed ""clean printer head"" function. This is awful and expensive. Never ever again will I purchase an HP product. I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm out of ink by only ‚Äúcleaning the printer head‚Äù and print ‚Äúalignment page‚Äù.

We switched from a cartridge printer HP 6975 where we spent $450-600 each year on

 Cons
 - When using the iMac 2022 model, the printer often loses the WLAN connection and only runs very quickly and reliably via LAN
 - the software somehow seems as if it doesn't really belong to the HP printer, I know it differently and much better

So I turned it off when not in use.  Sometimes for up to a week or two.
I cannot tell how much ink I have.  I am not sure if the $5/month ink program is worth it or not.  Since I have had the printer for 2 years?  I have paid probably $120 for an ink fee I have not enjoyed.
So- the printer gets a 7 for those reasons.  otherwise it seems fine.

I guess I was only allowed to have the scanner option until the end of the year.  Now I'm being punished.  I need to call-in again to HP and argue about this issue, but I get so worked-up.

One minute it will print, the next it won't. Sometimes with a connection problem I have to disconnect it from the mains altogether. It is hardwired USB to my modem.
I recently had a problem where the printer wouldn't work at all and diagnosed the problem myself with the faulty colour cartridge under the HP instant ink scheme. I replaced the faulty  cartridge with an old normal one and the printer starting working but would not recognise the old cartridge and would only print in black. It took around 8 days for a new cartridge to arrive.
Now I find that HP are increasing the cost of the 'HP instant ink' system by 28% starting next month (February).",IPH,131,2024-01-25 02:29:06,2024-01-01 00:00:00,"Cartridge Problem, Printer Hardware/Printing issues",negative comment

I I have used up the black cartridge supplied and the black cartridge .
I purchased at the time.
I was then very very very annoyed with HP as you have locked my printer preventing me from using the alternative manufacturers superior cartridge that give me approximately four times  more pages than yours. By Saturday I have to print out a further 600 pages.
I wish you to immediately advise me how that I can unlock and remove the monitoring  and continue to use the cartridge.
 I have noted that HP have been fined a large amount of money in the States regarding this and told to retract it.
 I shall be reporting this to the BBC watchdog program if no immediate satisfactory solution is given.
 I'm not interested if using these other manufacturers inks in validates my warranty.",IPH,169,2024-01-29 10:00:05,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Cartridge Problem,negative comment

 I understand your preocupation. Ink cartridges in HP and other brands of printers are often criticized due to their cost. Here are some reasons behind it:

 1. **Business model**: Many printer companies sell printers at low prices or even at a loss, recovering their profits through the sale of ink cartridges.

 2. **Cartridge Technology**: Ink cartridges often include advanced technology, such as integrated print heads, which contribute to the cost.

 3. **Research and development**: Companies invest in research and development to improve the print quality and durability of cartridges, which can increase their cost.

 4. **Competition and compatibility**: Although there are third-party options and cartridge refills that may be cheaper, some printers are designed to work best with original brand cartridges, which limits consumer options and can keep High prices.

 Although high ink cartridge prices are a common concern, there are also some strategies consumers can consider, such as purchasing refillable ink cartridges or looking for cheaper long-term printing alternatives. It is important to evaluate the total cost of ownership when considering a printer, including the price of cartridges and replacement frequency.",IPH,188,2024-01-29 03:12:04,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Cost,negative comment

 The HP smart software is really very poorly designed (heavy, often defective, unable to do anything as soon as the Internet does not work... in short, it is poor quality, poorly coded software).
 Furthermore, HP forces us to buy cartridges from the brand, which are excessively expensive. Disregarding free competition, HP refuses the purchase of compatible cartridges. And, against ecological moderation, the printer refuses the manual filling of cartridges.
 In short, to flee. I strongly advise against purchasing HP printers (I do so from people I know, at my workplace and on social networks).

The set up was difficult and did not work as expected.  The 123HP website first directed me to subscribe to a service so I could get a printer driver.  The service then indicated it had no driver for this printer.  I tried to connect the printer to Wifi and it would not connect with out a PIN  from the router label, which did not exist or a security code which I thought was the wifi password.  However the printer refused to accept that and there was no other security code for that. The printer also asked for the IP address , but did not specify of what.  I put in the router IP address and that was not accepted. Finally by complete accident I activated printer+ without getting the free ink deal and I got it to print, but I have to go through two additional screens every time I print.

It‚Äôs a complete proactive system.  The quality of these inkjet printers is impressive for a low cost printer.  
We use it for everything including 4x6 or 5x7 photo's to put in collages as well as everyday printing needs. Cartridges are easy to replace and ship old ones back using the prepaid envelope. With the new 8900 series printer HP came out with the 6 month free trial period with basically unlimited printing allowing you to see the performance and capabilities of the printer with no monthly charge which was great.

Filling the inm was harder since it presses down to click into place I like that there was not a mess. Although if you get ink from the new container just a little bit it'll smear all over the white casing, we can't get the smidge off. Putting the print heads on was a challenge to get the orange cap out, adding print heads; really different and hard to get into the unit. Quality of photo is 75-80%, could of been photo was too dark. I had not tried 5he scanner yet. But this prints faster and the prints with photos took a little bit to print but way faster then I thought it would. So far this printer for our family was a good choice, you can't beat the price for this kind of printer. These need photo chip or USB to transfer photos if they can't be shared via internet. This will be fine as long as there's no internet stalls or we lost our app. Plug into surge protector....I lost a different brand when we had a power outage.

To rub salt into the wound, I found that when I unenrolled, I could no longer use the left-over ink!
I have found 3rd party inks to be more trouble than they're worth, and so always use original HP nowadays. However, if you can't stand by the quality of your inks and let people make a choice, then you won't be perceived as a quality product. 
The idea of a subscription service for ink would suggest that HP is thinking of something similar for the printers (?).

And even though the cartridges in the broken printer were relatively new and the same numbers the new printer wouldn‚Äôt accept the old cartridges.  One reason I bought the 2015e was because this printer uses the same cartridges as the broken printer, thinking I wouldn‚Äôt waste the money I spent on the cartridges I was using in the broken printer.

I recently (three months ago) bought an HP printer. Within two weeks, it would not print in color. I put in a new color ink cartridge (proper size, legit HP brand) and nothing. So I used it for several weeks trying to impel it to print in color using the HP troubleshooting utility. Nothing. So I threw it away (thanks for nothing, expensive but unused ink cartridges) and bought a new, cheaper HP model which I installed yesterday. It printed the first few documents, color and everything. Today, it won't print and the error message says ""Can't find printer."" I'm so done.",IPH,111,2024-01-31 10:29:16,2024-01-01 00:00:00,"Cartridge Problem, Print quality",negative comment

Das ist besonders praktisch f√ºr jemanden wie mich, der den Drucker nicht regelm√§√üig verwendet.Ein Nachteil ist allerdings der Preis. Wie bei den meisten Originalpatronen von Druckerherstellern ist auch die HP 303XL recht teuer. Dies ist etwas, das man bedenken sollte, wenn man regelm√§√üig druckt und dementsprechend oft neue Patronen braucht.Insgesamt w√ºrde ich die HP 303XL Original Druckerpatrone weiterempfehlen, wenn man Wert auf hohe Druckqualit√§t und Zuverl√§ssigkeit legt und bereit ist, daf√ºr einen h√∂heren Preis zu zahlen.",IPH,134,2024-01-19 00:00:00,2024-01-01 00:00:00,Others,positive comment

Today is 30 January. I received the prompt that said the ink was low. I didn't understand why because throughout the month I had only printed 89 sheets including today in total. It was in the back of my mind already that I was purchasing ink pretty frequently but today caught my attention. So, I ran a report to view my printing patterns, and sure enough only 89 sheets. What was interesting is the number of sheets for prior ink replacements was showing similar all less than 100 sheets.The yield on this ink is stated as 200 sheets AND it boasts that it is supposed to print 2X's more than others. That is not my experience. This cartridge is not printing an acceptable amount AT ALL. The off-brands seem to provide more value. The HP brand is a rip-off.
