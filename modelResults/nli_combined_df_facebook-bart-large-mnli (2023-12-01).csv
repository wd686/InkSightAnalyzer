Crazy how I can buy a ball point pen for 50 cents and put it in a drawer and take it out a year later and it writes just fine. I would never recommend any to get a printer unless they are using it daily. Best bet is just to go to a place like FedEx every 3 months and print my 3 pages for a buck.",IPH,145,2023-12-01 10:28:22,2023-12-01 00:00:00,Printer Hardware/Printing issues,negative comment

I was disappointed I could not set up the Scan to Network folder option, and I have to manually decide where to store each scanned image.  I have always used the Scan to Network folder as my preferred way to scan.

I did NOT like that the installation process wanted me to use my phone to download an app I don't want to have on my phone.

 - From a scanning point of view, the HP SMART interface is correct but it lacks an automatic function allowing pages to be interleaved when scanning double-sided documents in 2 phases, scanning the fronts then scanning the backs, the software should then be able to insert them automatically. It is possible to do it manually but it is very difficult when there are many pages.
 - From a printing point of view, I haven't tried printing photos yet but the PDF documents I have printed are of very good quality.

 I must say that the service, as far as I'm concerned, is very satisfactory, I would say excellent. The cartridges have always arrived on time and without problems... it is a valuable and intelligent service.
 I really recommend it.
 The printer, like the previous one, has always been functional, only once it did not read a new black cartridge... found to be defective and immediately replaced.

 I can only be satisfied, thank you.

At first this was solved by cleaning, but later it was the plastic rollers that the repair service couldn't get. If you could get them, you could repair the printer and use it for much longer. In addition, the feed scanner will eventually get a black stripe, which is also unsightly.

 I have been a customer of yours for several years but this printer is not popular for 2-3 reasons:
 1: print pages or the side of these pages where the text is slightly missing, try to adjust the blank pages a little further to the right and more to the left...
 Then to finally manage to print correctly at the end,
 When suddenly the printer color says almost half empty for color 😱
 While I was finally able to put the sheets in better (I would like in the future a printer where you can insert the sheets inside so as not to waste too much time).

 2: it's complicated to scan or photocopy a double-sided document!!
 Besides, I can't do it with my new printer and it's annoying.

 With the old HP Envy printing company… I was doing well.


 I need a printer that does not waste my time so an efficient printer HP is very strong and I remain confident and I would not change the brand, (until a certain time) I prefer to return this printer to you and buy another new one.

 Sincerely

 Afterwards I had several HP printers but in the end I chose Epson 7 years ago. For the reason that the cartridges are independent and so if 1 color runs out, it is not necessary to throw away the entire cartridge with ink from the other colors. Thinking about price and environment too.
 But since I don't use the printer much, I use dry ink.
 And I'm back with HP. I bought the simplest printer available and this was it.
 Prints super well for simple use at home. And pretty fast.
 Also the cartridges are not as expensive as before I think. That's OK.
 The best thing about HP is if the printer goes wrong, the cartridge is changed and it works 100% again.

The first printers in the 90s were gems.  They printed very well and always printed when you asked it to.  However, they were black and white only.  For some reason, when you changed over to color, the problems began and they continued with promises of ""fixes"" to come.  I kept asking for a ""print every time I hit the print key"" and diagnostics that ""fixed themselves"" and with this Envy printer you are getting there.  I have had trouble with printing and having to start over a few times, but that is doable.  However, with the diagnostics there is still a problem.  The programs seem to find the trouble, but fixing it is sometimes not done with just a terse note about what is wrong or even sometimes a ""everything is just fine.""  I do like the color printing!  And the ink containers are excellent and fit fine.

The instant ink concept is great as you can change up or down the package as necessary.  Downside is that it is more complicated than a 73 year old can fathom to add more than one app to the printer.  I have the printer on my laptop but would like to print from my ipad and phone but don't understand how to add them.

First, I found your system to be entirely non-customer friendly, with long waits, dropouts, and marginal support. I dealt with two tech reps. One was negative (a 2) and one was outstanding (a 10), so my overall score was a 6. 
I literally 4 1/2 hours on the phone with HP to get my new printer working. The first four hours were with a rep who caused multiple issues, and she ultimately gave up, saying it might be the cartridges (which was clearly not the problem) and I would receive them in 10 days.
I spoke with Rep number 2 for a total of 30 minutes, initially to correct an account problem which came about during my dealings with Rep number 1. Within five minutes, including time speaking with her manager, she resolved the account issue, using a creative solution. I then asked her if she might be able to assist me with my technical issues.

I save more money on ink with HP than Canon.Canon ink does not last very long even if I buy the XL I feel they're cheating. There ink can cost over 60 dollars. Hp instant Ink program in a sense saves me a lot money and there ink last longer. The Canon printer is louder and the ink likes to smudge the paper paper after printing alot. HP printer ink will look like it's uneven printing after printing too many papers.

However my old HP printer was having problems with small photo printing so I bought the new one and changed over my instant ink plan. While waiting for my first in delivery I tried to print to my old printer as that still had ink but it wouldn’t work because it was no longer registered. I found this unfair and also odd as it still had ink to use and I did continue to have a plan for my new printer. The old printer ink had been paid for via the previous plan so what’s the problem?,IPH,107,2023-12-11 15:51:31,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Customer experience & expectation, Instant Ink related, Cartridge Problem",negative comment

With the old one I was able to scan double-sided using the ADF and scanning program. Apparently this no longer works with the new one. That's an unbelievable step backwards. When it comes to IT and HW, things should always go forward and not back. Then the whole thing became far too slow and there was far too much bureaucracy with all the data and consent that HP requires. I feel coerced, thwarted and spied on. This is no longer my HP, whose quality and sophistication I had always highly valued as a development engineer.

It worked. But again. I didn’t use it for a bit and had to go through the same thing over and over. Finally I’d had enough and went back to buying HP again.

You sent me a big packaging with only one colour cartridge inside, while I was missing the black one. Then, I bought the black cartridge by myself and, although it was original, my printer didn’t work as well, printing white papers. I changed three cartridges and paid too much money, I think. 
After some days you sent me the black cartridge apart, my printer is working not so good from a quality point of view. It prints very clear and I ensure you that I’m able to use my devices. 
Please, tell me how I can stop receiving and paying your cartridges.

Indeed, the cartridges are almost as expensive as the printer and compared to the manufacturing technique there is a big gap. In addition, the consumer buys the cartridge and throws the used one in the trash.

This time, I purchased an ink jet instead of a laser jet printer from HP.   

I did NOT like the ink jet printer at all.    The color was not sharp and the cartridges were hard to change.   Also, the cost of laser cartridges has increased to over $100.

I switched to a Brother laser printer.   I am very happy with the Brother because of easy set up and low cost printer cartridges.

After that everything looked perfect. It prints perfectly. However, it is a bit loud and what is really annoying is the constant LED lighting. Since it can update itself, you shouldn't turn it off and that means it stays lit all the time and quite brightly. It would be nice if you could simply turn off the light separately.

 It is very unfortunate that your printer manufacturer charges so much money for the cartridges. In times where people should live sustainably, their printer manufacturers are absolutely counterproductive. A final comment about the Hp + app.
 If I incur further costs, I will delete the HP account and go to the manufacturer.
 Thank you for your attention.

 Currently I am not sure if it is working, since occasionally the cartridges get stuck at the end of the carriage in a clean state, so I have to turn off the printer several times until I get it to work correctly.
 To conclude, although I have no complaints about the print quality, when the cartridges I have installed run out I will choose to purchase another brand.

* when it prints the printer shakes the table it is on
* it is loud when it prints 
* it froze when I was trying to get the printer instructions,  I couldn't shut it off, had to unplug it and now the icons on the printer have a weird color
* I started your free ink program and the one month of paper program. When I canceled the paper after the trial period,  you kept charging money from my account.  I could not get any help in support and after a few months of trying to correct the problem,  it said I had to stop the ink program.  So I  did. In doing that the ink cartridges I had received would not work in the printer.  This is bad business 😒. 
* it's hard to use your account on line

The HP dmart app sucks and if you don't print for 2 weeks or so the only way to make the printer connect to the app is to unplug it from the wall and plug it back in.

Furthermore the Instant Ink service sucks also. I have been waiting for almost a week and my ink still hasent shipped. I have 2 projects to print and no ink. A shipping label has been generated and I have a tracking number but no ink. If it goes much longer I will have to cancel the instant ink service and actually go and purchase a cartridge.

I was able to overcome them because of my prior experience with HP.  I felt the instructions could have been clearer in the documentation that was included with the product.
My main problem came with Instant Ink.  I didn't know that Instant Ink was going to be special ink cartridge not the store bought ink.  I installed the store bought XL cartridges I purchased and then found out Instant Ink was a separate cartridge.  I did't even use the small cartridges that were included with the printer.  I was just going to keep the small cartridges for an unexpected situation when I ran out of ink in the XL cartridges.

I don't care about any Terms & Conditions you worked up for this service that she may have agreed to. It's an aggressive and senseless marketing tactic that did not sit well with our family, nor anyone of a countless number of others she told.

You could have let the cartridge go to end of life and offer some other form of incentive to purchase cartridges direct from HP.

The one I recently had had a problem with the printer carriage not moving - upon investigation, it appears a little gear had broken which did not allow the carriage to move. This was a sudden failure - it seemed to be fine one day and broken the next. The thing that was frustrating was that it was telling me to reinsert a cartridge prior to the failure, and there was nothing wrong with the cartridge placement.

Personally, I find its print quality to be impressive, delivering accurate and detailed results on both documents and photographs, which is crucial for me as I work with high-resolution images frequently.

 The versatility these printers offer is outstanding. From wireless connectivity that makes it easy to print from multiple devices to the ability to automatically print double-sided, these features make the printing process extremely convenient and efficient.

 There is one point to improve 100%, which is the response speed in the scanner, its duration is quite long from page to page.

 Also, something I really appreciate is their focus on sustainability. They minimize waste by eliminating the need for disposable cartridges, using high-capacity, refillable ink bottles, which not only reduces long-term costs, but is also friendly to the environment.

 In summary, my personal experience with HP printers has been highly satisfactory.

This means if you're printing smaller items like labels, which use significantly less ink per page, you're effectively paying up to 10 times more for the cartridge, which is 10 times more already then the colord water you actually need.. Such practices is a total bs.HP's tactic of monitoring used cartridge IDs blatantly exposes their cognizance of public outrage over their inflated prices, and it's akin to a slap in the face regarding environmental sustainability.

 I gave you 10 because it doesn't even take 5 minutes to install it and connect it to WiFi.
 It prints fast, it's incredible.
 It's clean and clear, wow it looks professional.
 And the cartridges are at the right price level. Neither too expensive nor cheap. Just !
 I bought this Hp deskjet 2720 printer in Kosovo for my office in Kosovo.

 I have a Canon printer in Switzerland which is exactly the same price as the HP deskjet 2720, I worry about it all the time as it takes a long time to print.
 The cartridges are very expensive around 70.-fr.ch.
 Sometimes the anchor sinks, the texts come out in a hurry. I repaired it, there is nothing to do, it's the same.

 Subsequently, when I return to Switzerland, I am going to buy an HP deskjet 2720 printer.

 That's why I gave you a 10.

 Best regards.

I ordered ink on Amazon and ordered non-HP ink, that was given over four stars and people had good success with it. The HP ink was so expensive. Well, obviously that doesn’t work because HP seems to have a complete monopoly (and charges so much for their Ink), the printer won’t print using that ink. I attempted to troubleshoot with HP and to no avail. Long story short, I threw out perfectly good (and full) ink cartridges, both the instant ink ones, and the non-HP ones, have no printer that works as I don’t have ink.

He did something and they started coming to me. I then received a bill for a hundred dollars I believe and you, HP, locked up my printer! Unacceptable.

It took me a long time to find the applicable software for the 6978 and I’m still trying to figure out how to reinstall the printers in their original state.  In the case of the 4650, the instructions referred me to the CD that accompanied the printer; this was useless and HP should have allowed me to download the applicable software.  At this point, neither printer operates via my Wi-Fi connection.  If these issues can’t be resolved soon, I will need to buy replacements, surely not from HP.

What is also a bit slow with the aforementioned software is that it constantly asks for login details and you constantly have to log in for everything and anything.
 By the way: is the 957 XL cartridge in black no longer available?

My printer has been connected to my wireless network and I have had no issues printing.  I was then informed that it must have been a mistake by HP.  I have not received any additional ink since the first shipment.  I have no idea when I am scheduled to receive another shipment of ink cartridges.  The communication from HP is not very effective.  I will not be happy if I run out of ink and have to go buy cartridges on my own.  Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thx,

If one color runs out, the entire cartridge needs replacing.  Also, the ink cartridges are very small, so they don't last long. Secondly, the printer is small, so the copy area is small.  Frequently, when I try to copy a page from a book, I get a message that the original is jammed in the mechanism even though it is flat on the glass. This machine wasn't built for copying large, old books.  The flat screen is small enough copying from any book is challenging. In fairness, when paper is jammed in the copier, it is easy to remove.

3) The printer will not handle paper larger than 8.5 x 11for printing, copying, or scanning so legal size paper cannot be used.
4) When I bought the printer, I knew HP's ""Big Brother"" approach to monitoring printer use in order to force owners into using your print cartridges, but I still disagree strongly with it. If you are monitoring each sheet of paper that flows through, are you also monitoring what is printed on it? It also forces owners to use your excessively expensive ink.

Whether you block non HP ink or not is besides the point, as I have had this happen before.  Also, I was unaware printers did not come with direct hookups anymore.

i'd like to offer a suggestion, from setting up the printer, the hp ink service is heavily pushed, in the end i decided to sign up, but during set up, i knew i had cartridges supplied with the printer-and i wanted to use them-but could find no answer to the question on whether i could use them or not, because i had to join the ink service during set up, and it stated that the ink service cartridges were different and don't work if you cancel.

with a brand new printer, i was expecting at least half filled cartridges-but after printing about 10 pages including the test ones and a couple of black and white letters the ink cartridges are showing as almost empty !",IPH,140,2023-12-22 10:45:18,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Customer experience & expectation, Printer Hardware/Printing issues",negative comment

 I would like to inform you that since your last delivery of printer cartridges, the print quality of our printer ""HP DeskJet 2720e All-in-One Printer"" is in poor condition.

 We ordered new cartridges from Amazon and placed them in our printer on Wednesday 12/20/23. Immediately after replacing the cartridges, the print quality improved.

 We ask that you check your cartridges and let us know the cause of the poor quality.

It makes clear and great prints of things I copy of the internet (like bill pmt receipts, recipies with pictures, articles, etc), and copies scanned items really well, but it does not print pictures good at all, even when I use photo paper.  I tried copying pictures I took of my son, to use in his wedding reception, and they had lines all through them. (I even had a brand new ink cartridge in it.)  I previously had an older model of an HP scanner, printer, fax machine from 15 or so years ago, that made excellent photo copies. I could make my own cards that included old pics, prints for my son's science fair projects and more.  They all turned out great.  Downside, it was twice as big as the one I have now.   So I miss that aspect of having a printer.  Otherwise, I like it and use it constantly.  Other than photos, it makes great copies and I would recommend it for daily prints/copies.

BTW, I previously had HP printers - each lasting 6 years of great service.  %This ""wireless printer"" - properly installed via on line process wifi - just would not take print prompts from me or online tech support.  After 45 minutes of checking setup - tech support asked me to return the product.

a couple of constructive comments:.  1. HP setup instructions directed not to use USB connections during setup... The USB port was covered with a label..  Strange.   2.  The B & W and color ink cartridge lockdown covers are very lightweight for the purpose. FYI, my HP Computer is and has been fantastic as were my previous HP printers.

3)  Machine does not perform any more essential services than my previous Epson but is twice as big.

Second, the color cartridge worked briefly and never again. I checked the cartridge, replaced it, but after a few months it was strictly black and white. No signal from the machine of malfunction, so HP apparently never detected that I was paying for color and getting none.
The customer service is fully automated so there is no human being with whom to communicate.

Tech personnel on several occasions got the printer to work.

The printer kept becoming faulty with the same problem. 

After I became discussded with the printer and the service I demanded a replacement.

After 5 days I received the replacement printer.The replacement printer came without a print head, I had to take the print head out of the defective printer and install it in the new unit.

As instructed I installed the ink cartridges from the defective printer into the replacement unit.

The new printer would not work!  I spent several hours with different techs to set up the new printer only to learn that the printer would not work with the old cartridges because I bought the cartridge replacement program and new cartridges should have been supplied with the replacement unit!

I am totally amazed how incompetent the people that work in the warrentee section and the printer techs are.

The fiasco with my printer cost me about 12 hours of my life and did not end until the new printer was set up.

Granted I don't need to print often but I'm thinking these ink cartridges are very expensive compared to the ink well refill kind. Maybe it's time for a printer change.

I'd like to see the reds be more vibrant. Even with a brand new cartridge on a brand new printer on 24lb HP paper, large fields of red look kinda faded out. Of course, I'd like to see the cost of ink come down a bit. After about three cartridge replacements the ink cost me more than the printer. Over the life of several of printers, ink replacements went obsolete (HP IIIP laser jet) while the printer still worked fine. What's that got to do with this purchase?

Cons -  I have not been able to scan and have scan sent directly to my computer, which would save a step from scanning to a USB drive and copying to my computer. I did not see value in the Instant ink program - it seemed fairly expensive.

2) Color printing is dull and not vivid like you'd expect from a $400+ printer.

3) Very disappointed. I've been an HP fan for many years, but since I just bought it I'm stuck with it.

4) I'm telling all my friends and students to be very wary about HP printers.

5) My printer has to allow other volunteers (for my nonprofit) to produce a document on their computer at a remote location and print it on my printer at my location. My HP printer, two printers ago, easily let me do this.

6) What printer should I have purchased that does duplex printing, produces decent color output and allows remote printing?

7) Why don't you send me a new printer that fits my needs? I'll then tell everyone how great HP is. But right now - no.

 The 9015e seems less robust and the HP Smart software less user-friendly.

 The documentation recommends installing with the iPhone but it doesn't work.

Ittakes up to a week to get backup cartridges whenn one runs out - but is ordered automatically when the cartridge is changed.  But the biggest peeve is that the ink just runs out - no notices that the cartiridge is low - and the document just stops printing or prints crappy so it looks awful.  That said, you have to stop what you are doing, figure out which ink is the one that is causing the problem, hope you have backup, change the cartridge (hopefully the correct color) wait for it to cycle through), reset the print job to reprint in full color, wait.

Also, sending good cartridges (with more ink than regular consumer versions) then disabling them if the customer doesn’t renew is both wasteful and insulting. Wasteful because a good cartridge becomes trash. Insulting because we discovered you can make longer lasting cartridges but don’t unless it benefits you.

Joining the ink program was awful. Trying to use non program ink when I ran out was impossible. The page count was off. The printer constantly stopped working and required me to find someone on YouTube to help me troubleshoot. The hp app was unreliable and not very helpful. Customer service was uninformed and unable to help. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I eventually knocked the printer off the stand in a moment of frustration and broke it. So many times I had to go to FedEx office because it stopped responding and I was under time crunch to print.  So I will never again buy an HP printer. I was warned by others not to get a wireless printer but I am not sure if it’s wireless or that it’s just a “lemon” of yours. I’m not the only one who had this problem experience with this model.
