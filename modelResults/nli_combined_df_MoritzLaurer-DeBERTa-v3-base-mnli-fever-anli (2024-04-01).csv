 But what we find unfortunate is the price of instant ink which has increased in recent years... Going from 15 free pages per month to 2.25 chf for 10 pages. Although we concluded the subscription at 1.50 chf, it’s still a 50% increase!

Although I wish the screen could be bigger. It’s small or compact enough that it doesn’t take up too much space on my desk. Everything is just so much easier to use. I found that for some reason, the 6978 printer doesn’t print well with the ink cartridges I get from the recycled or the less expensive HP re-ordering cartridges.

Some were cheap and felt cheap. Some were quite expensive but were worth the extra money for the quality of both the machine and features and also the end product.  I have to be up front and say that this Officejet Pro8024 was my son's printer. which he bought last year but he soon replaced it with another HP printer but one that ink is loaded from bottles. He offered the 8024 to me as my former printer suddenly stopped working after many years of great service. 
So far, I am very impressed with the 8024. I think the ink is a bit pricey, and I know I could pay less if I enrolled into the ink scheme but great scheme that it seems,  I don't like being governed by how many pages I print in a certain time. Some months I print more than others. Overall the printer is excellent quality, great features and thank heavens the paper is loaded flat from the front and not those silly back loaders.  So, very good and it matches my HP Pavilion PC  !",IIC,199,2024-04-02 09:20:02,2024-04-01 00:00:00,Print quality,positive comment

My printer stopped printing because it was out of ink. I decided to sign up and get ink delivered regularly. To do this I had to print out the info page to get the printer details. Thinking it had no ink I thought it’s not going to work but as if by magic it printed it out perfectly! I thought maybe I could print a document out that I needed but when I tried it said no ink. I thought I’ll press the info button and and sure enough it printed perfectly and did so for the 6 times I did it after out of curiosity. I’m unhappy that it wasn’t possible to print my document but had plenty to print yours!!!! 
I would be grateful for a reply

For being the promoted service that HP is steering customers towards, it was inexplicably difficult for you to take my money and enroll me in the service.

 I had a lot of trouble getting it to work the first few times because the print drivers are so badly designed that I was on the verge of putting it in the recycling center.
 Let me explain: the gauge indicates that there is still a bar in the ink visual but in fact it does not print. So one of two things. Either at one bar it refuses to print or at one bar it is empty.

It is incredibly difficult to print anything from my phone that needs to be smaller than A4, and the print area never quite lines up to the paper, often printing over the edge. The paper feed can be unresponsive also, and claim there is no paper available when there is. Quite often I have to restart the printer in order for the paper feed to function. The reason for purchase was because my previous HP printer just stopped working and would cost more to repair than the value of the printer - the part you sold for it was more expensive for the original printer. I decided to stick with HP because I like the convenience of the instant ink - though you have now stopped sending recycling bags for the used cartridges.

If it takes that much ink to start it up, you should really include 2 full sets of cartridges.
2 - The Cayn ink cartridge never seemed to initialize, because it still shows 100% full. When trying to troubleshoot this problem, it is hard to navigate the app/website/printer to figure out where best to go for this type of ""support"". 
3. I set the printer to turn off after 1 hour of activity, this setting appears to do nothing.  I haven't even started to figure out how to do that.

 In addition, the color cartridge appears to lose its fill level dramatically after just a few color pages have been printed (from the iPad). This is also described in detail on the Internet and has been negatively assessed.

A few years ago I signed up for the instant ink, I thought it was a good economical product. For us, using our printer occasionally I found it very expensive, as my ink cartridges lasted a very long time. The one time I used my printer to print a booklet I was charged an extra fee.
I cancelled instant ink, then I was not allowed to use the inks that I had paid for and HP wanted them returning!! Instant ink is not a one size fits all as we were very much out of pocket.
My husband and I love your machines and only buy HP products, but instant ink is unfair.

Given the small cost of a replacement printer vs the high cost of ink and paper and with tax season upon me I felt it was more expedient to replace it rather than try to repair it.
The new 2700 printer cost only $50. and was available the next day from Amazon.
The 2700 is a much lighter and more cheaply made machine but seems to work as well except for smaller and less versatile paper input.
My biggest complaint about it is that the UNLIT left hand rear top control and display is very difficult to read.  I will probably need to rig a small light source to it.

When I print photos the picture contains 3 lines through it.  I reported to HP.  They replaced the printer cartridge holder.  That did not resolve so they replaced the printer.  It still does this.  Its very disappointing that Im unable to print a quality photo and documents.  I would not recommend this model to anyone or purchase anymore HP printers as I use it for my craft sales.  Poor quality.  I spent over $250+ for this printer originally and HP cannot resolve this issue.,IIC,94,2024-04-10 05:17:45,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Print quality, Cartridge Problem",negative comment

1. The 2700e is harder than most printers to set up and is quirky when power goes off or a problem arises. It is not user friendly, particularly if a local network goes down. Furthermore, it cannot print on both sides, a feature that is a given even on the least expensive printers.

2. The ability to have HP provide ink on an as needed, subscription basis sounds wonderful. But when I found out I was not using it enough to warrant the cost, I cancelled it. I then learned that the print cartridges I had paid for no longer worked. This was not clearly communicated when I bought the product.

In our small office I had the opportunity to buy a printer and instead of choosing HP, we made the switch to Brother and have found it easy to set up, easy to operate and cheaper with the ink.

 The printer does not provide any information, for example on its status, ink level or possible problem. Often it no longer works and the only way to resolve the problem is to unplug it and plug it back in, which is not a correct solution and takes a lot of time.
 Logging into my account on the app is extremely slow, (unlike all other apps), it takes me about a minute to access the information, after which I rarely check it.

 In previous experience I found myself very badly with HP Instant ink as the delivery of the cartridges is not in tune with their consumption, so in certain periods I had 8 cartridges aside and in others I ran out of them without having the refill that I had regularly paid.
 the Help desk is impossible to reach. To speak to an operator you have to follow impossible menus. I'm sorry but I will NOT subscribe to HP Instant Ink again.

I have had at least 2 hp printers so I ordered a new one based on my experience with the previous ones.  I was disappointed when I removed the printer from the box.  The “lid” appeared to be constructed of laminated cardboard.  I keep printers for 5-7 years so I didn’t think one made of cardboard was going to last the duration.  Second, I inserted the temporary ink cartridges and did the test print.  After that, I kept getting error messages that meant one of the following:  paper jam (How could that be already?), install new ink cartridges (This didn’t make sense either, would instant ink cartridges be delivered to me by drone within 15 minutes of me signing up?).  It was late and I didn’t have the patience to keep problem solving so back in the box it went and I returned it to the store.

Now I’m searching for a different printer comparable to the hp Envy I had before.  Maybe it will be another hp, maybe not.

For one thing the Router is a long way from the printer and reception can be poor.  For another I want to buy ink when I want it and where I want to buy it - not when you think I need it and at your prices.

So I bought a cable (as one wasn't included in your box) and eventually managed to connect it and use it after watching several Youtube guides. I don't understand why it should pose such a problem.

It worked well when I used it for the first few times.  But I tried to print something I urgently needed at the weekend and it failed to work.  I don't know why.  In the end I tried to link the printer to laptop through my Wi-fi and found that incredibly difficult.  In the end I had to give up and used an old epson printer and old laptop to print what I needed.

With upto 3years of ink that alone in cartridge savings will pay for the printer & added advantage of getting extra years tank replacement is great value. 
I would recommend these printers 5 Star ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

 I have already sent a few emails to HP and, according to the instructions they gave me in the same way (change cartridges, turn off/on, align cartridges, etc.) the problem persists. It should be noted that I always buy and put original HP cartridges in the printer, never recycled ones or from different brands. Whenever I made the substitutions, sheets were printed with the usual settings. Result: I used up 3 cartridges (although the indication of a new/full cartridge appeared) and I used up a lot of paper+ink. In short: I gave up on printing, I use it for copies or scans.

 I have already written to you three times to say that my ENVY 6020e All-in-One Printer is not working. I cannot print anything. Everything was OK for a long time, then you changed something and nothing worked anymore. I was supposed to register again, which after many attempts did not work. I spoke to your technician twice on the phone, but he could not help me. He guided me for about half an hour, then we were back to square one, with no result. He said he would call me back, but he never did. So I have not been able to print for a long time. I have told you this three times, to no avail. The amounts are being debited even though I have not been able to get any cartridges for a long time. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE DEBITS until I can find someone to help me get the printer up and running. Otherwise I will have to reject the debit.
 I hope I get an answer this time.

 Best regards

This failure has cost me a brand new set of cartridges in only 3 months is use at $99.00 dollars for the x4 needed. Therefore this printer has become more expensive to utilize than it is to leave sit.

I am not able to use the printer as my HP app will not connect to the print.

2. One of the reasons that I don't want to set up an account and give you my email is the assumption that you will send me annoying spam asking me to fill out surveys like this - which of course you did.

I don't want an 'experience' when I turn a printer on - I want to print a document, ideally without having to endure an 'experience' in order to accomplish that.",IPH,143,2024-04-10 11:36:19,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Instant Ink related, Others, Printer Hardware/Printing issues, Customer experience & expectation",negative comment

 On the one hand, the printer is good, it is fast and complete, but when you choose an HP you do not choose for the printer (since there are many on the market with the same features and cheaper), but for its HP Instant Ink service.
 It is because of this other side, this service, that for the moment, I give it a fail.
 Their ink replacement service is slow. It is well thought out that the printer warns of low ink through Wi-Fi, but its delivery must be faster and more express, since this low ink warning does not provide many more pages.
 It takes 10 days for the ink to arrive, which leaves that billing of ""one month"" to print ink (which HP boasts) in actually less than a month, because the ink takes a long time to arrive.
 Therefore, half of the billing to print your plan (now I have it for 700 pages) remains in half a month.",IPH,166,2024-04-15 03:17:28,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Printer Hardware/Printing issues, Instant Ink related",negative comment

I also had issues w the ink rubbing off the surface of the photos. I used the same photo paper I'd been buying for many years. The printer would spit out several blank pages before printing or print just half the photo. I called for help several times. The customer service reps were very nice, but weren't able to resolve the issues. I finally resolved some of the issues myself through hours of research.

It constantly has issues thinking it’s low on paper when it’s not, ink low when there’s still ink, or simply not working for unknown reasons. The standard troubleshooting is not adequate. It usually does not solve the problem. This all probably leads most people to believe they need to pay for the extra services so they can get help. A printer should have support because a company stands behind their product, not so they can milk more money from their customers. These printers are generally for non-business individuals who don’t want a subscription for maintenance and troubleshooting etc. I just want a decent printer for home use without all the hassle. I never know if it will be smooth printing or more than an hour troubleshooting and maybe eventually being able to print. (Unfortunately, and sadly, this is not unique to this printer or company.

 1. You do not have to log in to HP (with username and password) to perform a scan.
 2. As for the design of the equipment, I prefer the completely black multifunction equipment, (if not completely white), which is just as I have seen in your range of products on other occasions, since I think it is more elegant.

Color ink cannot be purchased in a single cartridge.  Three separate cartridges are required, and each is quite pricey.

Without 4 ink cartridges, the printer setup process cannot be completed.

Cartridges that clearly HAVE ink are designated as depleted.

Ink depletes quickly.

Printer setup is difficult and the screen instructions are insufficient.

Once the printer receives a default name during setup, and name change by the user requires rerunning the complete setup from scratch.  The ""printer not shown"" feature on the device itself does not allow synching to the printer identified in the device list on the computer.  Using the ""adding a printer"" feature on the computer does not update the printer options automatically.

I followed instructions and got it to copy, scan, and print black and white from my computer but not color from my computer.  I was unable to fix this using your online help options or by looking around the internet.  Ultimately I was able to reach several of your technicians who did not seem to understand the issue for a long time and then suggested that they download more malware protection (at a cost) and then that I buy a roughly $200 service contract or at least a $100 one time service after which they could fix the issue.  This seemed very strange to me as the printer was brand new and under warranty.  Was this a scam of some sort?
Unless I get an explanation from someone I will not be likely to use HP products in the future or recommend them.
Apple support was easy to reach, very pleasant, and able to fix the problem quickly.

We were pushed into buying a printed for my husband. The salesman lied by saying,  these were the inkind replacements for the two hp printed that stopped working. They were not.
We ended up with a very complicated monstrosity that prints 2000 sheets a month. My husband is lucky to use 100 sheets a month and 2 faxes a year. This was clearly someone that wanted a commission so bad that he lied to a long standing customer of instant ink. 
 
The so called manager also lied when he said, “ We wish that we could make you happy.” 

I suggested they reimburse us for the difference in the printed that truly was the one that replaced his old printer. It  should have been  in the 8000 series. He kept trying to give me free ink or an extra warantee. Useless crumbs. 

We are on the HP ink program so basically he offered worthless solutions.

Horrible sales people and even worse 
Problem solvers. 

Since the whole thing was completely miss handled, I could not recommend 
HP printers from whomever it was that we were transferred to ftom Ho ink. Shady operation.

 I find it very difficult for a young, digitally savvy person to find out where to find user manuals. When I call up the manuals, some things don't work (a video page on scanning was completely missing, etc.). Chats with the robot don't work because it often doesn't understand simple questions and repeats itself.

 However, I am very reconciled by the fact that when I call the hotline I always meet friendly, patient and competent contacts who have been able to help me so far.
 Of course, a normal, detailed written instruction manual would also be very helpful and might make some hotline calls unnecessary.

The first problem is that is is a wireless printer - not at all convenient for me. I use wireless features all the time but when I chose to, not because I am forced to. I bought this unit as it can be connected by a USB but even the set up has to be done by wireless. 
The second problem is that the cost of a printer is insignificant in comparison with the ongoing cost of ink and HP does not offer a good ink program. The program offered is again only based on consumption tracked by wireless but I intend to only use it on a wired basis not wirelessly. Why not have a good program for being able to order ink as you need it from HP. I am buying genuine HP products anyway but why have to do it through Staples or Amazon and not from HP?

 We tried to complain about the printer. Unfortunately, as the printer is not defective, we cannot open a return. According to HP, the fluctuations in the filling of the ink cartridges are completely normal and not a reason for a complaint.

When will HP EVER get printer drivers right????  The installation of the AIO onto 3 different computers on my home network took 3-4 hours.  Way to complicated and unpredictable.  I am still stomping down bugs an annoying issues.

2) The gross and repetitive over-marketing of the ink delivery subscription ""service"" was onerous.  Modern business needs to discontinue the subscription model.  Give us high quality HW/FW/SW right up front, and charge a reasonable amount for consumables.

3) Based on the marginal quality delivered to-date by this product, I again expect this printer to last only 1-3 years like all of the recent HP products that I have purchased.

What is not fine is HP updating firmware and blocking non-HP printer cartridges and/or blocking HP cartridges that have been refilled.  My understanding is that the government told HP that HP had to accept non HP cartridges.  That lasted for a little while but it seems that HP now has updated firmware that violates that order.
   I am now considering a tank filled printer but am wary of what HP will do to prevent anyone from filling the tanks with non HP ink.  
   I have been a user of HP computers and printers for years and years but am now looking at other manufacturers because of this proprietary stance that HP is using on it's printers.

 I am very satisfied with HP products in general, it is the brand I have chosen for my laptops and printers for quite a while now. For example, my HP 8020 printer, which is dated, still provides me with great service. As for the Smart Tank 550, I am disappointed on several points: no feeder for scanning or copying several pages at once (forced to use the glass, page after page), location for the printing paper very narrow (little capacity), network very complicated to install, front panel not very intuitive and limited in possibilities, plus finally another major flaw: I was sold the printer as having to last for three years in terms of capacity. ink, it's true the compartments are still full, but I realize that your ink bottles for this printer generally expire after a year... This therefore means that the ink used from the second year is out of date... However, the print quality is good and I don't spend anything on ordering cartridges unlike all my other printers.",CISS,174,2024-04-17 06:01:13,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Print quality, Customer experience & expectation",negative comment

 I already have the 6th HP printer in my life. (Retiree)
 I have always recommended HP to my company.
 Now I have bought an HP printer for home use for 59,00€.
 What I don't understand is why old people are lured into a subscription trap for printer cartridges when setting up such a cheap product.
 I activated HP+ and was very concerned about signing up for a subscription.
 I called customer service, who assured me that this was not the case.
 I now hope that I will not incur any further follow-up costs.

 We already had an HP printer. Unfortunately, something broke on it. I would have loved to buy another HP printer where I could have continued to use the ink cartridge. Firstly, to protect the environment and secondly, to save money. If that had worked, I would have actually told friends and acquaintances that this was possible with HP. Unfortunately, the purchase was very frustrating. Please think about sustainable business and not just commercialism!

They are useless and the sound is even unpleasant and too loud. Recognition of the Mac Pro with the printer even when the two are on top of each other sometimes does not work, or even often not. The time between turning it ON and being able to print is far too long. There should be an easy to find icon when searching for consumable level information. This is not at all intuitive. Positive points: the cartridges do not dry out when you don't print for a while unlike the HP mini printer used 3 times which I had to throw away because I had to change the cartridges each time I needed to print 3 pages, 70€ thrown in the trash.

But I know printers don't last much longer than about five years it seems.  Plus HP really needs to work on the graphics for showing how much ink is left of each color.  I have experienced that the graphics appear to show you have ink in a color.  I would print something and there was not enough for the print job.  Then the next color appears to still have ink but then the very next re run of the original print job runs out again.  This is really frustrating when you are printing with photo paper.

No information given during the installation process of the new printer. 
Secondly I assumed that the printer I ordered would be able to do duplex printing. I ordered the all in one because it had a document feeder. Duplex printing should be a given as it saves paper. I’m also disappointed that there is no way to view the printer configuration on my laptop…way too dumbed down for my taste.
I did exchange the printer for an Envy model which supports duplex printing but doesn’t have a document feeder.

I don't print a lot and was wondering if HP put some type timer/expiration in so that after a certain time it just reads as empty - seems like by 3 months it no matter how much i printed it would says I need to replace the black ink. When I was signing up for insta ink it said I average 8 pages per month For the amount I print I should have had many more pages printed for the amount I spent. Sorry I have to write but too many times I went to print and had to order another cartridge. Hoping w/ insta ink it will be better.

For people who print a few times a month, the inkjet cartridge is the most recommended: if there is a problem with the cartridge, simply replace it and the problem will be solved. The price of the cartridge is consistent with the needs of bimonthly use in a home office, that is, excellent value for money.

I have had a few cartridges that’s have had a very short life with very low output. It appears that HP can disable these cartridges remotely and I wonder whether this is happening to mine. I did once use your replacement cartridge system which was pretty good but because my printing needs fell to a really low level, it seemed pointless to carry it on. I still had a couple of cartridges under that system but you disabled these which I thought was quite shocking and unpleasant. After all I had paid for them under the arrangement. Also, my supermarket was actually selling these cartridges and when I bought them they wouldn’t work. Your advisor told me they were the wrong cartridges because they were distributed via the replacement cartridge system. So why were those , even available from my supermarket? Cost me about £45 and I lost this. So it has left me a bit suspicious about HP practices.",IPH,181,2024-04-28 10:39:10,2024-04-01 00:00:00,Others,negative comment

I can buy a new printer with starter cartridges for less or close to the price of cartridges.  When I want to print so.ething it is cheaper to go to the library or office depot to print.

 My sister recommended this to me and helped me register since I somehow couldn't manage it myself.

I would provide better messaging in your software and maybe a stick on Key to the printer itself in the language needed. Printing a problem page uses up ink and page count all beneficial to HP ink sales not user experience.
2) The Printer drops offline and fails to reconnect.  This requires me to use the HP doctor almost every time I have a print job also requires I hardwire the printer to the computer.

I got a replacement printer after all the verification tests to prove that the printer is faulty. I used the replacement printer for a year before it break down again. The service team attitude is horrendously rude and prescribe to replace the ink when the machine is not able to print in the first place.  Nevertheless I waited for the ink and replaced it knowing it doesn’t solve anything. Meanwhile I continued to pay for the auto ink replacement.  I contacted the service team once again which the service personnel finally pronounced the machine is ‘dead’ with absolute no suggestion nor even sounding indifferent. I have requested to cancel the ink subscription immediately in order not to incur additional expenses but was rejected outrightly as it is not part of protocol.  This is worst ever experience I had so far in any printer or IT products purchased. I will NEVER NEVER buy another HP product and would not want anyone I know to go through the same experience!,IPH,179,2024-04-29 22:11:05,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Instant Ink related, Customer experience & expectation, Cartridge Problem, Printer Hardware/Printing issues",negative comment

I keep getting printer errors and there is no reason that I can find why this keeps happening. The printer has nothing to hold the paper in place in tray one so it is constantly moving causing a paper printer error.

Cartridges: Too expensive for the number of prints you get—no bang for your buck. 

To replace it is a hassle. The cartridge is more difficult to remove and put back in compared to other HP models.

Average: How to get this to work with HP Smart, it was a bit of a work. Not plug and play, and the software recognized the new printer. Also, when I had a new internet/network box, it was a hassle to get things connected properly. It took me 60 minutes or more.

Butttt this products has been a challenge for us seniors.  ( 85)

We only use a printed every now and then so we never wanted the ink program
But when our free trail offer time was up we couldn’t use our printer any longer
With the ink cartridge we purchased on line from Amazon (still HP)
We had to get service involved to help us and it was a crucial time
We ended up paying someone to print out what we needed
We did get it set after 24 hours…..
Then the darn thing gets disconnected and we have to go through the app to fix it
It’s just a lot for simple folks
We picked the wrong unit obviously…..we were picking based on size as it had to fit in the same spot as the old one…",IPH,141,2024-04-30 23:23:31,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Instant Ink related, Customer experience & expectation, Printer Hardware/Printing issues",neutral comment

The cartridge finally depleted, so I switched it out for this one and it shows a message that it is an older generation cartridge that won't work with my printer! I looked at it, as I've never had this problem before, and the warranty ends in 2019! So it is very old. Like I said, I just purchased this in March of this year. Since I'm just now using it, it's too late to return and I'm pretty irked about it.
