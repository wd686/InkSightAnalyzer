The old printer (and it’s similar replacement) does not feel well made and feels flimsy and engineered to be fragile (a cynic would say this is to increase sales turnover).  I also like being ‘locked in’ to printer cartridge usage (but tolerate it as a penalty of owning the printer), however I wish that HP would stop similarly pressing their ‘paper plan’.

375177837,Others,negative,0.5726808309555054,"First,  I had trouble setting up the printer because the HP Smart App wouldn't work. I had to call HP. That agent was really nice and helped me get the printer set up, but now I have THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HP+/INSTANT INK & PRICES FOR EACH ONE, AS WELL AS CONFLICTING WARRANTY LENGTH. When the agent set this up,  he said I would have 2 years warranty instead of one. Yet, on my dashboard on your website, it says I have 11 months and 17 days remaining. I set the printer up on Mar 26, 2024. I should have 23 months and 17 days remaining. In addition, the paperwork that came with my printer said that I could enroll in HP +/Instant Ink for 100 pages@$5.99/mo. I chose 100 pages on the app, although it said it was for $4.99/mo but now it says I have 50 pages for $4.99/mo. The paper enrollment I chose was $1.99/mo. In one place on your website it says I have printed 152 pages of 700. I don't think that's correct. In another place on your website, in my account, it says I'm not even enrolled in HP+/Instant Ink. In the email you sent me today, it states I've printed 82 pages in this billing cycle. Regardless, I signed up for the 100 page, NOT the 50. And which price IS it? And why does my account say I'm not even enrolled in this ink/paper program, while another place on your website says I AM? Furthermore, I can't even get the HP Smart app to WORK on my computer - I can't use my smartphone because it's too old and I don't have enough memory to even download it on the phone. When I try to pull it up on my computer, it's just a blank white page and I can't even close out of it. I literally have to restart my entire computer to get rid of it from my task tray and shut it down. I requested someone to call me - it was supposed to be around 10 minutes - and that was over 30 minutes ago. So no, at this point, I'm not too happy of a camper. I like the printer, although it sucks ink up like a sponge, but I can't say I'm happy with HP itself, since you seem to be all over the place in what you're saying I'm supposed to be buying for a specific price.

There is no rhyme or reason to when it decides to not work - it might go along fine for days and all of a sudden decide that it's off-line and refuse to print.  Then there's the scanning. One of the main reasons I got this particular printer was because I wanted to do a lot of scanning of two-sided items. I finally gave up entirely on this. Again everything has to go through the internet - or smart whatever you call it - and usually it says I don't exist and need to make a new account - I do exist and did have an account and refuse to go through making a new one and all the hoops required to make a simple scan of something. And then there's the instant ink deal - which had been another selling point for me because I had loved it with my previous printer. Now I don't know if I can count on it or not.

So this is in keeping with the possibility that you have built this product not to last much longer than your 1-year guarantee. The only reason I have replaced the failed unit with the same model is that I had taken out a 3 year support agreement with Curry's, who confirmed the ""paper jam without any paper - and without roller debris"", and replaced the failed unit.
The Currys support agreement continues. The first unit failure occurred on the FIRST time I had to replace a cartridge, so I will be interested in how long the new unit lasts, and whether it survives a cartridge exchange.

I use only a fraction of the allowance and am disappointed that this is not taken into account. It would have suited me better to have been offered an option of dropping to 25 sheets. 10 are too few, especially when half of these are used up by the printer malfunctioning.
This brings me to the printer itself. Now once, since acquiring  it, has it printed off what has been requested, first time. It always has to be woken up (unplugged, replugged, restarted) and then wastes at least one sheet printing half a page instead if the whole of the requested job in the queue.
I have been using HP printers (as well as other makes) since 2002 and this has the worst performance of any, in response to requests, choice of settings, sharpness and clarity of prints, especially on HP papers, which are not white enough for colour vibrancy. Photo papers in particular give a dull result. It dies not readily accept a range of papers. I sometimes like to use a pearl finish or semi-gloss but the Envy produces an unsatisfactory result.
HP can do little about these faults, I presume but when this printer dies, I shall be looking fir something more reliable and versatile. Why can't HP produce a machine with the same photo quality as printer I had from you more than twenty years ago? You must surely still have the same technology available."

The black ink is consistently fuzzy or blurred on the right / left edges of print until many test pages have been printed/print heads cleaned. I should not have to do this every time before I print.

It's like a blackmail situation, which is totally unreasonable. I can cancel at anytime but won't be able to use my printer. Having to keep the printer online at all times is shitty because of the light which shines in my room at night. I liked the instant ink plan but without the high jacking. I would have bought something else if I knew first. Because life happens I could have to cease the service due to loss of income or not been able to afford internet long-term or consistently. I'd like to be able to use the printer should these things ever happen which is likely. Not very fair. I would rate HP 9 or 10 if I can switch back as needed."
376081519,Cost,negative,0.9633267521858215,"(1) I strongly dislike that you have to make a choice on Day 1 that affects the entire life of the printer. If you decide to go with HP+, you can never ""undo"" that decision. And you have to decide that before you ever use the printer, use HP+ or its features, etc. It feels forced. If you were confident in your products, you'd allow people time to come to an informed decision, either by being able to add HP+ at any time down the line, or by allowing folks to cancel without any permanent penalty. If you decide later you don't like HP+, you basically have to buy a new printer, which is total BS.

(2) Information was inconsistent. Is the Instant Ink free trial 3 months or 6 months? Found references to both numbers in both the printed information that came with the printer, the information displayed during setup, and the confirmation emails (e.g. after setting up Instant Ink for 3 months, the ""welcome to HP+"" email said I'd get 6 months -- and even later in this very survey it says 6 months!). Same thing with the prices of Instant Ink, which were one number in the materials, but then a higher number when you actually go to set it up. These were obviously changes that were made at some point that have not been updated everywhere. This doesn't inspire confidence in your attention to detail, and makes an impression that you're just trying to make as much money as possible off the ink and monthly services, with the printer itself feeling like an afterthought. I wonder if you don't want to go totally to the cell phone model and just own that your real business is now ink & paper with a monthly subscription fee, and make the printer free with e.g. a 12-mo commitment."

We ordered the printer and 2 back up packages of ink replacements 3/14/24. It arrived the following Monday. I began to set it up on Tuesday 3/19/24 and it did not work. I got print system errors telling me that the ink cartridges were leaking and to check them and if leaking contact HP and if not reinstall and restart. They were not leaking so I went with that option. Still the error occurred. After an hour of trying on my own, I contacted HP support. They tried to help and had me do everything they could think of to solve the problem and then had me open a BRAND NEW pack of ink and go that route, still did not work. So now I have opened and wasted 2 packages of ink. They tell me they believe it is a faulty print head and that they will be issuing me a new one. Ok, fine. However they did not mention that they old one needed to be sent back, it was not a big deal but just an irritation that I now needed to go to FedEx at the end of a long day. It took a week for the print head to get here. I had to reach out and tell them that our shipping department closes at 2:30 and since it was Friday we are not open on the weekend it will need to now wait until Monday to be delivered, so now we are looking at 3/25/24. 11 days after the original printer was ordered. A week after the original printer was received. The print head was not the solution, I installed it and used the set up ink that came with it and it did not work. I reached out to support and after an hour and a half of chat and videos they decided they would replace the printer. So I ask what the procedure is. They need a $1 collateral in case we don't send it back, ok fine. ""When will it be here"" they tell me by April 10. April 10th?!?!? That is not ok. I tell them that is not ok it needs to be here sooner, they tell me they can get it here by the end of the week for $25 more. I tell them ""no that will not work. Do not process this. I want to speak with a supervisor"". I never heard from one. I called the next day 3/26/24, at this point I am very upset. The printer was faulty out of the box through no fault of ours and we would have to pay more to get it here sooner? that is not right, that should have been on HP. Had the printer worked like it should have I would have had a working printer 3/18/24, but if I didn't want to pay additional money I had to wait over 3 weeks to get a working printer? In what world is that right when the customer did nothing wrong? In the end HP came to their senses and did not charge us the extra shipping and did ship overnight. Then came the FedEx issue. We are a manufacturing warehouse, so our hours are earlier than most and our shipping and receiving dock closes at 2:30 pm. I got the notification that it was going to be delivered by 10:40 am, i thought ""no problem"" then I got "" its delayed and will be there by 8pm"" well obviously that does not work. I called HP and they told me to call FedEx. The first day it was fine since it wasn't on a truck yet. The 2nd day however, it was on a truck and they could not do anything since HP does not allow FedEx to change anything. So I called HP back and they would not help me. Once the new one came, there was no set up ink that came with it, well it requires new, unused ink. so I had to open my last thing of ink. Overall, I spent over 5 hours on support with agents, I called HP at least 4 times, FedEx at least 3 times, emailed HP 3 times, and have opened all the ink I bought as spare ink. I have used HPs my entire life, in fact when researching printers for our business I made the decision for this printer because of the brand and I am feeling highly disappointed. I now have to spend at least another $130 to get more spare ink."

Previous generation (which was a couple steps down in model still had this option)worked just fine but frequently would loose connection. Your products are a waste of money.  Scanning is now super difficult. Instead of scanning to an email it has to scan to a device. Scanning to email works once out of twenty times. Makes it difficult to do on the run. Stupid printer ink bullshit….  Stop with the subscription hooks makes you a car salesman. That’s how I see HP.  Make the ink affordable upfront. Your games make you untrustworthy.

The “free” print ink is a scam as you are promised free ink but if you don’t use it it’s wasted and when you need it you can’t even use the damn printer 🖨️ without having to call some rando kid in Costa Rica to have a fight about why the printer you paid for doesn’t work. Didn’t even work after buying way too expensive ink that the Beat Buy guy accused me of stealing because I had the old stuff in my hand because I the scam free stuff wouldn’t work and my kids had ti have a printer or I needed to print a legal document - HP made one of the most stressful moments in my life due to this. The printer won’t hook up to Internet half time and trying to do that is difficult. In this day and age should be easier and “greener” than that. I felt like HP had taken my money then stolen my ability to print back. Took hours upon hours. I will never have that time back and will never ever accept or recommend their damn print ink monthly program - one of the biggest scams I have ever been through. At least with CD clubs back in the day, the CDs still worked after quitting the club. I would rather pay $20 per week for my child to have shader mods in Minecraft than pay $1 per month to HP for such scam. At least my son gets something worthwhile out of the money.

I just have a nack with old HP and Canon copiers and printers as I have two that continue to fight the odds and will work so I still use them for black and white and color as I need to use their ink cartridges up.

Hewlett Packard
1501 Page Mill Rd MS 1247
Palo Alto, CA 94301-1112

Dear Hewlett Packard (HP) Complaints Representative,

I am contacting you because I am thoroughly disgusted with the amount of problems I have encountered with HP since leaving Dell Computers and Printers.

Recently while attempting to switch printers from my ENVY 6400 series to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 for my home-office, I was told something that was very disturbing for me. I was told in an email HP Instant Ink that they could not cancel my subscription until after the next billing cycle on April 29, 2024, nor could I return the unused (still in shipping package), for my ENVY 6400 series even though they are still in the packet they were received in. 

Because of my age (87 years old) and in that category that has never been trained how to do certain things on a computer, I subscribe to the HP Smart Friend at a monthly cost of $16.99 per month. For the most part, that is working out for me, however, when I am transferred to two or three departments for the same thing, that does not bode well for me, and mainly they are asking me to perform the same procedures the person I was transferred from had me do. I was told that I could return my tempted cartridges for recycling, or donate the unopened and unused cartridges to charity in more than 60 countries. Territories and regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North and South America through the HP Planet Partners program. What an insult!

I have so many case numbers that I cannot count them, however, the latest one is: 5122040597 and it was only to install my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 Series printer, cancel the Instant Ink Cartridges, and transfer my subscription to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015. I am trying to remember how long and how many transfers I had to go through to make that transition. And to add insult to injury, I received an email welcoming me to HP’s Paper Add-on Service 1. I have never ordered paper nor do I plan to order paper, I will continue purchasing where I have purchased for over forty years.

Corporations like HP and greedy stockholders are doing everything within their power to drive America into bankruptcy at a high rate of speed, by contracting everything to individuals or companies outside of the Continental United States of America.

I have to be up front and say that this Officejet Pro8024 was my son's printer. which he bought last year but he soon replaced it with another HP printer but one that ink is loaded from bottles. He offered the 8024 to me as my former printer suddenly stopped working after many years of great service. 
So far, I am very impressed with the 8024. I think the ink is a bit pricey, and I know I could pay less if I enrolled into the ink scheme but great scheme that it seems,  I don't like being governed by how many pages I print in a certain time. Some months I print more than others. Overall the printer is excellent quality, great features and thank heavens the paper is loaded flat from the front and not those silly back loaders.

After my wife unenrolled, I was unable to enroll in Instant Ink for weeks. I could get mostly through the process, then would get an error.

For being the promoted service that HP is steering customers towards, it was inexplicably difficult for you to take my money and enroll me in the service. Finally, after several weeks, and deliberations on whether we should just go buy ink in store, or to replace the printer with a different brand that offers support that I can get a hold of, I decided to try one last time to enroll.

For instance, when I wanted to upsize a copy to 180% I had to just keep increasing the enlargement by 1% at a time, as opposed to typing in 180% once.  Also, when scanning I have to go to my computer and use you app to do so, as opposed to just pushing the scan button.

The quality of the prints has exceeded my expectations, and I am very pleased with it. However, I am currently facing technical difficulties. This is likely due to my lack of expertise in navigating the Internet, as the printer has disconnected and I am unable to print. Despite my attempts to troubleshoot the issue, I have not been successful due to my limited knowledge. I plan to seek help from my grandson or someone else to reconfigure and set up the printer for me. I also purchased photographic paper for the printer as I enjoy taking photos and turning them into framed family treasures. Overall, I believe this printer is a valuable tool, especially with its ink supply setup, which I find to be an excellent feature."

I had an issue with my HP printer connecting to my phone and mobile devices in order to print from remote locations for my job. When that feature worked well I loved my printer. When my printer wasn't available or there were issues with ink levels and other minor operational hiccups, I was livid. But that is true for any computer product from any company these days. There's not enough simple clarified instructions to operate your equipment especially senior citizens. 

If someone were to ask me about an HP computer or printer they were looking at I would encourage them to buy before buying overseas or buying Samsung. I don't have a comment on why I feel that way. You make your assumptions. 

I have an HP laptop and it is awesome. I have an HP all-in-one table top and I enjoy that as well until it became irrelevant out of date and no longer able to use like I did. I find that to be compelling and also frustrating when a consumer spends $800 on a computer setup and 5 years later it's obsolete. But that seems true for all computers and companies. For all computers and companies."

I couldn’t get any print. He lied and wrote that the printer was fixed. It was broken. It was trash. I will buy any printer except for HP.

Add a second notes the monthly in charge never allowed any ink to be serviced to my house. I had to call when I need it ink. And then when I finally got it, they wouldn’t allow me to use it to test with the technician, and I had to buy my own 

All around HP screwed up. I’m both your monthly service and your technical support. The printer is in the trash. And I will never buy anything with HP on it again."

377202887,Cost,negative,0.8677407503128052,"I found the printer to be OK but resented that my use of cartridges were tracked.  My most disappointing experience was with the the Ink Program of which I cannot recall the name.  I got a six month trial per the agreement and found the program not good for me because of the infrequency of use because I am away from my printer.  When I cancelled the program, I was not allowed to use the cartridges I had not used but paid for and also had to pay another cartridge purchase to exit the program.  So, I paid two payments for cartridges that I was not allowed to use and did not receive any cartridges.  I have been a loyal customer of HP over some 45+ years but I do not plan any purchases of a HP Printer anytime in my future.  I took the 8028e off line though it is a perfectly operating piece of equipment and for the first time in my life bought an Epson    Figure what it cost to gain a consumer and you lost a long time customer on principle and approximately $22."

377565768,Others,negative,0.8265738487243652,"I used to have an HP printer that lasted nearly 15 years. I bought that in 1998. I was very impressed with its longevity and quality, so based on that, not only have I bought another HP printer but I also bought an HP laptop...however neither are impressive at all. Frankly, they suck. I know you only want to know about the printer today, so all commentary and this survey herein is in regards to that. The print quality is good. No argument about that. However, when I turn my printer on, it takes 5-10 minutes for it to ""warm up"" and start working. This should not be the case. It has always been like this since Day 1. Other printers I have used and owned in the past (including former HP printers), they start working within 10-15 seconds of turning on. Surely this long ""warm up"" phase cannot be intentional. Second, I have only used this new printer maybe 10 times (I dread having to use it...that should tell you something), and the black and white print cartridge low ink indicator has been blinking for months. Now, there is no way I have gone thru that much ink because I just simply have not used it much, but yet the electronic indicator indicates that it is low and needs changing. I don't know what the truth is, but this should not be happening either. Again, I have printed very little on it. So, would I recommend HP printers or HP products (I have major issues with my HP laptop too)? No, I sadly would not. In fact, I will be buying a new laptop this year, and it will not be an HP product. When it comes time to buy a new printer, I will not consider HP. Sadly, product quality at HP has gravely gone down and your competition is too good not to consider. HP has become the Ford Pinto of electronic products. It pains me to say that but it is simply true based on my experience with this printer and other recent HP purchases, but I won't be fooled again. To be honest, a score of 5 is generous above."

When I loaded new HP printer cartridges in my new 8015 printer, by accident loaded yellow in the blue slot. I fixed it immediately but the printer said I was not using a genuine HP cartridge (for only the yellow cartridge).   I tried to get help on the website but there is no option to explain anything or provide specific issues or feedback.  No way to get remediation.  No place to send a letter, a cartridge etc. Entirely frustrating.  I have frequently experienced problems with HP devices in the past and stopped purchasing them due to lack of even basic support, but my husband bought the 8015 and I am stuck with it.   In addition, HP is not abiding by the rulings which are intended to offer print cartridge options.  So, no, I am not satisfied with HP as a company or my HP printer.  Do better."

After unsuccessfully (following HP Smart) getting the printer driver - I simply could not find it to connect wirelessly - I bought a cable to connect directly.  That also did not work.  I called a tech support organization which I have to pay for - since HP doesn't have one for installations - to get the printer to work wirelessly. It took them over an hour to figure out how to get the printer driver downloaded and work the printer wirelessly and they followed many of the same HP Smart steps I did.
The next day, the printer did not work wirelessly even after restarting multiple times.  I reconnected the cable, and the direct connection worked.   
The next day the HP Smart program popped up again, so I installed the printer driver again and took advantage of the HP ink program.  I lived to regret that the next day when the printer stopped working again.  I have now connected it directly again. 
Any money saved by buying this printer or using ink through HP which requires the wireless connectivity is offset by the lost time, productivity, and cost of making a simple connection to the computer.

Decided to go the Smart Tank route this year to cut back on the insane prices and limited ink content you get with cartridges. Time will tell how well this printer will perform, but as far as putting ink in the ink wells, that was a breeze and no drips anywhere. The tanks and caps are well designed and appear to be of high quality to protect the ink from drying. Set up was a piece of cake. I watched a couple of You Tube Unbox and Set up videos and then just used the Smart App. The App is a great feature, well layed out, very helpful and takes all the guess work out of doing it right the first time.

It would be like any other manufacture that forces you to use their brand where they can control the price and make the end user pay the cost.

378481884,Quality,negative,0.7888215184211731,"I find this model to be unfriendly for users due to the panel not being easy to read. While there is a user manual available, a typical user may not always refer back to it when needed. Additionally, the design is not user-friendly for older individuals.

Furthermore, the product quality is low. The printer I recently purchased broke down and I experience paper jams frequently. It seems that HP printers tend to break down within a couple of years. As a long-time user and supporter of the company, I used to associate HP with reliability and quality. I own an HP monitor and laptop too. However, I now need to search for another printer and will give another brand a try and take this opportunity to cancel my Instant ink subscription. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide my feedback."

HP Ink:

 I recently cancelled my instant ink and these are the cartridges with remaining ink. 

I used ‘instant ink’  because it was offered with a promotion on a purchase of a new printer. 

When I realized I wasn’t using the amount of ink that would make it worth my while I decided to cancel. 

It was the end of the trial and when I called it was a holiday, Good Friday, March 29, 2024.  I didn’t realize I would have to return the cartridges and that my printer would no longer work until I replaced them with store bought cartridges until I went to print the paper work from the cancellation. No stores open on Good Friday.

The agent could have made that more clear really.

I did get new cartridges the next day so no big deal really. 

In the beginning they sent me one set of cartridges and I was to replace the ones in the machine that had come with it.  They weren’t barely used but you had sent me new cartridges so  I sent them in the recyclable return envelope provided. I thought that was the deal. I guess I could have kept them as they came with the machine. Then I would have been able to use the printer after cancelling instant ink. 

So I was shocked that you wanted the ‘instant ink’ back as I had only used 1/4 of them by the end of the free period. The only set of cartridges I received for the whole free period time.. I thought that was pretty poor for you to take them back not completely used but on thinking about it further they are coded to be able to see when I need ink so I kind of understand now about that. Still I was very surprised that you would need them back. 

In conclusion I have been pretty satisfied with the printer HP OfficeJet 8015e. Sometimes it tell me to “check for errors”.  Still not sure what that means. The support technician said I should unplug it and plug it into an unprotected (non surge protected)  outlet.  I tried that I still get the error.  It is printing ok just not sure what that means and I didn’t get an error code. If it persists I will call tech support again.

I have had many printers from Hp and some very expensive ones when I was in business. I am retired now for 17 years. I am now on a fixed income. I hope you won’t be charging me for cancelling one day after the monthly period. I had not used the printer at all after that monthly time period. The agent at “instant ink” ( when cancelling) said I wouldn’t be but in that email attached #3 says I will get a final bill. I don’t think this is fair. Can you please correct this?

Respectfully ,

Betty Ann Tweedy."

Remembering the passwords, getting connection cords hooked up to key in the information....then after no use for several days I go to print a long document and the machine quits because it tells me I have to contact HP because some issue about the number of printed pages?

The printer was advertised that it came with 6 months of free ink once you sign up with InstantInk. After signing up I was advised that I get only 2 months of free ink. The contents of the box say 6 months free ink as well. That took an hour of my time including sending screen shots to HP support to actually get the advertised 6 months free ink. So extremely poor implementation of an offer that only leaves your customers pissed off. Next, the warranty shows only 9 months left even though I only bought the printer 3 days before and it's advertised to come with 24 months warranty once registered. Again, another hour on the phone with HP support and scan and send receipt and I still have to speak with support tomorrow to confirm the advertised warranty is applied. When speaking with support I let them know that they are sending me French only support email and to switch it to English - which the 300 items I had to fill out over and again clearly state. Today I was sent another email entirely in French. HP has wasted about 4 hours of my time in order to fight for things that are advertised as ""free"". My time is not ""free"" HP. I would say lights are on but nobodies home at HP."

Cons: It is very slow to print a page and to print double sided you have to turn the page yourself.  Had I known this I would not have chosen this printer. The set-up took some time and I struggled but eventually got there.

The black ink has since sorted itself out and is no longer skipping, I haven't printed anything that would use the red yet beyond the first day. I attribute ink issues, possibly, to the cartridges being old, as I bought printer a few years ago and never set it up. My main issue is with the wireless setup. Initial setup went well, connected to my network and everything else. I had the printer do an update and it lost connection to my network. Now it fails to connect. It has no IPv4 address on diagnostics and it wont connect to any of my devices (smartphone or PC), so I can't get into the printer to troubleshoot it. My last resort is to try and set it up using the USB cable, which is of a Type B design, which isn't supplied and I don't have."

Worse yet  - for customers who have a question about this complicated system. Not knowing what to ask, who to call is a waste of time. Depending on which customer service rep you get you may or may not get help. Reps should not be on phones until their English can be understood.  (My family speaks English as a second language). Its demeaning to reps to have to make them repeat what they are saying because they can not be understood.  Bottom line. HP has become too large to provide better service to customers.

This is because we had bought our first HP Deskjet 4130e printer before the printer we currently have registered.  After the first day or so we noticed that the power lead would not connect to the three pin socket at the back of the printer. We returned this to Curry's and they exchanged it for another model.  when we exchanged this printer we questioned the sales person why do Curry's sell products that are faulty and not raise a discrepancy with the manufacturer.  I had no logical answer other than ""If this printer is the same as the last, we'll keep exchanging it"".  Evidently no genuine customer support to eradicate the problem.  When we set up the newer 4130e we found that we had the same issue.  On return to Curry's,  they demonstrated that the power lead is quite difficult to connect to the printer and customers have to force the female three pinned plug on to the male three pinned socket which was encased within a sealed unit at the rear.  During this fiasco, we already had registered our first printer with HP for auto-renewals of print cartridges and had to cancel this and set up the new one.  Then we started to get statements for two printers one which was returned/exchanged and the new one.  Thankfully after my wife contacted HP we only receive the one monthly statement.  The only problem I have is that when I print and email (CTRL-P) eight blank pages are printed and no email.  Also  I have a very good Smart Tank Plus 555, however, when I upgraded my PC to include Windows 11, I am unable to install a driver because your website does not recognise the model or serial number and the HP Print and Scan Doctor does not resolve the issue either.  I still have spare printing inks for this printer which I used for photography.

Why not send the replacement as soon as we install the new ink cartridges?  Why wait?  Then when we have to print multiple pages for a project, we are out of ink.
- the paper feed many times pulls in multiple pages.  Therefore, I am wasting ink and paper because we need to reprint.  Very frustrating!!!  
- Ink cartridges are hard to open - when turning the cap to open it before installing into the printer.  An older person, someone with disabilities, or myself would really have a difficult time. Many times I have to use something to give me leverage to take off the orange cap. 
-  Ink cartridges have leaked numerous times when first opened.  Stains on carpets, clothes, etc.  I know I love at a higher altitude, but I wold of thought you would have tested this before going to market with this product.

Because of my limited space, they go all over the floor instead of remaining on the printer until I remove them.  If I've missed this feature please let me know!! I'd even consider buying an attachment to solve this problem if it folded or retracted (again, due to my limited space, i cannot have something permanently sticking out).

Also, I'm not pleased with the color printouts.  I usually print my quilts on regular paper, not even in photo mode (with my old (really old) HP printer and those had better color resolution than this printer.  I did download the smart app today and re-printed as photo, high quality.  These printouts are a little better but not great.  Hopefully I'll be able to go into Photo Shop and somehow tweak this.

379303420,Others,negative,0.6821522116661072,"I have been a loyal HP customer for decades (printers and ink) but always seem to have difficulties with HP tech support.  Many years ago I was always pleased with your tech support's ability to address my problem on the first call.  Over the last several years your tech support capabilities has severely degraded.  Your reps are courteous, always promise they'll fix the problem, and are quick to say they are sorry for the trouble being experienced.  However, if the solution is anything beyond the simple steps I could have preformed on my own, it takes hours of time on the phone over multiple days until I ""force"" my way to a more knowledgeable resource that can easily fix the problem.  This experience was evident after buying a new printer earlier this week and trying to set it up.  Here is what I encountered while setting up my new HPOfficeJet Pro 9135e.  Plugged the printer into the outlet, went through the setup procedure, after installing the Black ink cartridge I got a message on the printer to check the cartridge for leaks. After inspection, no leaks were found and I reinserted the cartridge.  The message then said I needed to use a new cartridge so I used a new black cartridge purchased when I bought the printer.  After installing it, I got a message that the cartridge that came with the printer was required to continue the setup.  I reinstalled the original cartridge and the message was that I needed to install a cartridge that wasn't already used.  I returned the printer to Staples for a new one.  I successfully set the new printer up.  There was one problem...every function worked except the ability to print files in ""draft"" mode.  After working with Jennifer for 40 minutes, loading and reloading new print drivers, we still had no success.  We scheduled a follow up call for 4pm later that day.  At 4:18pm I still hadn't received a callback.  I called HP support and went through the same process with Roman who concluded that I needed to speak with the software support team.  Roman promised me that he would explain what he and Jennifer did to address the issue to the person I was being transferred to before making the transfer.  When the transfer was made, Oswald told me I was speaking to the SmartFriend team, that he received no information regarding my issue, that their service was not covered under the printer warranty, and that I would have to pay for any support.  As you might expect, I was not happy and ended the call.  I called the tech support line again and asked the representative (Sam) to speak to a supervisor.  I explained that Roman did not do what he said he would do and that I wasn't going to pay to address the issue.  After requesting to speak with a supervisor, Sam transferred me to Daniel who fixed the problem within 10 minutes.  This is the experience I needed to go through just to make a basic print function operational on a newly purchased printer.  Now for the real reason I'm really disappointed with HP.  The reason I had to buy a new HP printer was that my family got used to using the Shortcuts you can establish in the HP Smart App application.  I use these shortcuts to allow all family members an easy way to scan and forward important information. I owned 2 HP OfficeJet 9015 printers (only have 1 now after trading in one for the 9135e purchase) that have been working perfectly for years.  Two weeks ago both printers could not access the HP server to reflect the Shortcuts on the printer screen. The message indicated that the printer could not reach the HP server and to try again later.  After days of getting this message ,I called HP support.  I informed them that there must have been a change by HP that interrupted the connection since 1. It was working perfectly on both printers for years 2. Both Printers reside in two different homes, in two different States, on two different Wifi networks, on 2 different Internet provider services. 3. Both printers lost the functionality at the same time 4. I could connect to the HP server via my HP Smart App and launch the Shortcuts via my laptop and Samsung phone apps.  After investing well over 30 hours to fix or, at least, identify the issue, I was told that I needed to buy two new printers.  I finally gave up and bought the one associated with my experience highlighted at the beginning of this writeup (still need to buy another to set it up in the Rhode Island location).  I was so frustrated by the experience I became short, impatient and, at times, rude which is not like me.  I suggest you listen to the tapes and read the service notes to gain more insight.  I hope this helps HP improve their customer/tech service, but my expectations that anything will change is very low given past performances and feedback.  Also, I did read on user forum sites that HP was having server maintenance issues that may have contributed to the printers inability to connect in order to reflect the Shortcuts on the printers....couldn't get anyone to even consider it as a possibility."

When she would some time to respond, I did not rush her response time at all. At the end, she even disconnected the chat due to her impatience. She was not even capable of answers all of my questions and by the time she disconnected, I still had more questions. 

I still do’t understand the whole purpose of HP+. From my understanding, I have to pay in order to use the ink. If I don’t pay for the ink that the printer already came with, then HP will have my account suspended. What’s the point of having the ink come with the printer if you still have to pay to use the printer after? 

In order for this new printer to be used, I was charged for prior balances on my account that I didn’t even know I had. I was never made aware of any prior balances until I got this new printer. I still don’t even know what the prior balances were for because it is not stated anywhere. How it is even possible to have prior balances? In order for there to be a prior balance, that means that I was supposed to pay for a service or product. Assuming that I did in fact receive a service or product, how did HP allow that without me paying? It doesn’t make any sense to me.

When I was charged for whatever prior balance was there, apparently I wasn’t even charged the full amount at one time. Which again, doesn’t make any sense to me. HP was not transparent about the amount of money that was supposed to be paid. I was charged for one prior balance amount one day, then the next day I was charged for the other prior balance. By the way, Elize said that I would have to re-enter my card information for my card to be charged again. That makes absolutely no sense. 

I was supposed to receive Instant Ink for 6 months for free according to HP. According to Elize once the second balance was paid, she could give me a credit that would offset the payment for this month. If I am supposed to have Instant Ink for 6 months free, why would I need to pay for this month? Under my HP account, it says that I won’t be charged for Instant Ink until September.

Color ink cannot be purchased in a single cartridge.  Three separate cartridges are required, and each is quite pricey.

Without 4 ink cartridges, the printer setup process cannot be completed.

Cartridges that clearly HAVE ink are designated as depleted.

Ink depletes quickly.

Printer setup is difficult and the screen instructions are insufficient.

Once the printer receives a default name during setup, and name change by the user requires rerunning the complete setup from scratch.

I cancelled Instant ink and received the cancellation email confirming.  I have new HP I’ll I purchased so I put in the printer but continued to receive error messages about requiring an HP account.  So today I called back in and was transferred 3 times before I finally was connected to someone who understood my dilemma and promised to help me.  At this point I’m 45 minutes into this call but was happy to finally have someone assist me only to be told oh I’m sorry but your warranty expired last week.  I explained that I didn’t want another warranty, I just needed someone to assist me with changing whatever needed to be changed so that I can use regular HP ink instead of instant ink.  I escalated 4 times only to be told by each supervisor the same thing.  You need a warranty for service after I repeatedly told them that I just needed to know how to make my $300 1-year old printer work with my $60 HP ink.   Finally I got to@a “case manager”
Who was beyond rude. She also repeated told me I need a current active warranty or pay a one time fee for assistance to which I replied that I would never purchase another HP product after this experience and will definitely not need a warranty.  She refused to escalate my call to her supervisor.  By this time I was 1:45 into the call.   I finally gave up and told her I would be contacting the corporate office regarding this issue.

Ultimately I was able to reach several of your technicians who did not seem to understand the issue for a long time and then suggested that they download more malware protection (at a cost) and then that I buy a roughly $200 service contract or at least a $100 one time service after which they could fix the issue.  This seemed very strange to me as the printer was brand new and under warranty.  Was this a scam of some sort?
Unless I get an explanation from someone I will not be likely to use HP products in the future or recommend them.

We were pushed into buying a printed for my husband. The salesman lied by saying,  these were the inkind replacements for the two hp printed that stopped working. They were not.
We ended up with a very complicated monstrosity that prints 2000 sheets a month. My husband is lucky to use 100 sheets a month and 2 faxes a year. This was clearly someone that wanted a commission so bad that he lied to a long standing customer of instant ink. 
 
The so called manager also lied when he said, “ We wish that we could make you happy.” 

I suggested they reimburse us for the difference in the printed that truly was the one that replaced his old printer. It  should have been  in the 8000 series. He kept trying to give me free ink or an extra warantee. Useless crumbs. 

We are on the HP ink program so basically he offered worthless solutions.

Horrible sales people and even worse 
Problem solvers. 

Since the whole thing was completely miss handled, I could not recommend 
HP printers from whomever it was that we were transferred to ftom Ho ink. Shady operation.

Also found Tech Buildz to be a highly suspect company referral. I honestly think I was scammed by them from the beginning. And I do not appreciate it all their way of collecting a fee. Producing a check and falsely signing it on the back and submitting it to me is illegal. But also way to avoid a credit card company coming back on them for false or erroneous charges. I feel I was totally duped because I was desperate to get a printer up and running and after you invest at least an hour or two you want to see it through to the end. However when they wanted to charge and exorbitant fee for virus protection I became more convinced this was all a scam. Adding insult to injury the quality of the print on this printer actually stinks. I am very unhappy with his purchase and I'm seriously considering returning it. I am also unhappy that in the process of supposedly debugging my computer they signed me up without my permission for the ink program which I would never have agreed to and they deleted my existing virus protection. Making me more suspicious of all that went on that day. It is if you are in cahoots where you let them scam a user to buy and use your printer with no choice in purchasing printer ink.

I did some investigating and found that I'm not the only customer who feels like the instant ink and/or HP+ isn't something that I think I will like.

The second problem is that the cost of a printer is insignificant in comparison with the ongoing cost of ink and HP does not offer a good ink program.

2) The gross and repetitive over-marketing of the ink delivery subscription ""service"" was onerous.  Modern business needs to discontinue the subscription model.  Give us high quality HW/FW/SW right up front, and charge a reasonable amount for consumables.

The arrival date kept getting delayed, and I teach on Zoom and needed mh printer to prepare my lessons, this was very inconvenient.  It took many more hours of my speaking to reps and a supervisor at tech support until I finally I got to a case manager who was able to get my new printer delivered within a week. All told, it was six weeks from the time my first printer arrived until I received a replacement.  I understand that machines can fail, but it should not have taken nearly that long for me to receive a replacement.  Every time I called tech support I was told different information about what it would take for me to get a new one and send back the old one.

I have never had any printer except HP for over 20 yrs.  My last one, an 8610 pro, lasted 9 years, and when the printhead finally failed, I had an ominous feeling that I would never have such a good machine again.  This proved correct!

Also, it wouldn't always work with the wifi so I would have to use an ethernet cable. Some people just want a cheap model that prints but nothing else. I do like that I can scan and copy.

The first representative discovered that my replacement printer came without “start up”. cartridges so the replacement printer would not print with the regular cartridges.  He tried several things but nothing would work. He spoke to his supervisor and the suggestion he came back with was for me to send  this printer back and they would send another one. That would mean I was going to be sending the broke printer back as well as the new replacement printer.  That was not acceptable.  I needed a printer and I had waited for about a week for the replacement printer.  I did not want to hear that I had to wait 7 days to two weeks for another printer.  He went and spoke with his supervisor and returned with a method of overriding the preprogrammed printer.  To my pleasant surprise it worked.  The representative named Aamir refused to give up.  His heart was in helping me the customer with the printing problem that was created by the people responsible for shipping a replacement printer to me without the specially programmed ink cartridges. We spent a lot of time on this issue and I was exhausted after we finished but I was happy that I was lucky enough to get Aamir who was determined to help me get this printer started. He got 6 stars from me.

The second representative did a great job as well because the next day the printer wouldn’t print.  He too was very thorough. He found the problem and took off the baggage  electronically that was preventing the printer from printing.  Both men were examples of excellence from your company!!!!!

What is not fine is HP updating firmware and blocking non-HP printer cartridges and/or blocking HP cartridges that have been refilled.  My understanding is that the government told HP that HP had to accept non HP cartridges.  That lasted for a little while but it seems that HP now has updated firmware that violates that order.
   I am now considering a tank filled printer but am wary of what HP will do to prevent anyone from filling the tanks with non HP ink.  
   I have been a user of HP computers and printers for years and years but am now looking at other manufacturers because of this proprietary stance that HP is using on it's printers.  Reduce the price of your own HP cartridges and maybe the public will continue to purchase original HP ink.  Your carts are way, way, overpriced."

It has sometimes insisted there is a paper jam when there is no paper jam. The only way I have found to rectify these issues is to reboot the printer. Right now it insists the black ink cartridge is not installed (it is) or that the tape is on the cartridge (it is not), so it's printing only from the color cartridge. Even though I have performed all the troubleshooting instructions at least twice, it still claims there is no black ink cartridge. It is the most recent one HP Ink sent on the ink replacement program, the same number as the previous cartridge. I don't understand why HP Ink hasn't sent a new one if the printer is sharing the information that there is no black ink cartridge installed.

381107578,Others,negative,0.5490286946296692,The printer setup was easy but I can’t get the ink to print.  Otherwise I love HP products.
381115707,Cost,positive,0.8286088109016418,"Low price of the printer, very easy to install, no need to purchase ink cartridges several times a year"
381115893,Others,positive,0.6908966898918152,HP is what we use. It doesn't fail. You guys jest need to figure out a single ink design and stick to it because we have printers that are extremely difficult to find ink for because your cartridges change every year.
381120220,Others,negative,0.900989294052124,Both ink cartridges that came with printer didn’t work.  Black non existent and colour patchy.  Worked ok after sourcing new ink but poor start.
381126586,Others,positive,0.8212805986404419,"I have been using HP Printers ever since I purchased my first printer. This printer was one of the easiest printers I have ever used, before I knew it I was set up and ready to go.  I really like the idea of not having to go out, to purchase both color and black ink cartridges,  The idea of having ink refills is ready to go when I need them.  This printer has made things much easier.  Thank you"
381136269,Cost,negative,0.9239629507064819,Didn't like paying for cartridges in order to print.  Had to purchase a subscription plan otherwise I couldn't print.
381136498,Quality,positive,0.8776599168777466,"Great packaging
Easy instruction setup booklet

ink tank design is outstanding. was sceptical moving from cartridge but the tank design and fill is child's play.

But what I love about it is the fact that I can print from my phone because it's wifi connected and I don't have to buy cartridge all the time because it is using ink.

381182710,Others,negative,0.6918054819107056,I haven’t gotten any ink at all. Except when I initially signed up. I installed it immediately because I thought ink came every month. And returned the cartridges that were probably full.
381187929,Quality,negative,0.9706557989120483,"After 6 months the printer failed to print correctly. Cleaned print head, new inks all failed to improve the quality. Hp doctor app was useless in offering a solution. Threw the printer out in the end."
381189211,Others,positive,0.7193774580955505,Initially I was sold a printer that did not have the functionality that I requested of the HP phone salesperson.  When I called back in to do an exchange the person I worked with was very helpful and accommodating.  Love my new printer and also continued my instant ink subscription as well as I have been a long time customer.  Very satisfied and refer many colleagues to HP and Instant Ink.

381213918,Quality,positive,0.9981922507286072,"Easy to install using my iPhone. Thrilled that it is wireless!!
Makes clear, precise copies. Full color is beautiful. I love the bars that show when your ink is getting low. Easy to install the ink cartridges and it doesn't seem to use a lot of ink.
Very good quality."

381219440,Cost,negative,0.9166346788406372,"I did not recently set up this printer. A relative sent me this printer when I still had a working HP, so it sat unused for quite a while. Once I started using it, it was adequate for printing and scanning daily documents, but I did not like how the digital menu worked and/or didn't work. Considering what the printer must have cost, it didn't work very long. The cost to replace ink cartridges is excessive. The digital menu stopped working and I had to replace it with a printer with an ecotank that will be less expensive to use."

It must be the way you make your profit - but my cartridge would stop working even when I knew there was still ink in it.  I gave the printer away and bought an Epson.  I've been an HP customer for many many years, but you lost me."

381222597,Cost,negative,0.874101459980011,I really do not like the monthly ink subscription. I have no idea when I will get my ink and ultimately how much that ink will cost me (in monthly charges). I really REALLY do no think a subscription is necessary.
381222797,Cost,negative,0.9135373830795288,When I initially started your guys paper and ink program renewal program it seemed like a great idea. However during my time with you guys we never received any ink and I once we decided to stop paying for the monthly fee we no longer can use our printer. Apparently that ink I had paid on for close to a year or more isn’t actually ours so we don’t get to use the remainder of it.

Also, to get it to print, sometimes I have to disconnect the printer from the power source, wait, and then reconnect the power. And most annoying, I keep getting an annoying message saying I am using ""cloned "" ink cartridges. This is not possible since the cartridges came with the printer."
381224958,Others,negative,0.9250221848487854,I hate that I have to have an ink subscription for the printer to work. I will never buy HP again.  I can’t return the printer because once I realized the subscription was necessary for the printer to work it was outside Best Buy’s return policy

I would not recommend this printer at all!!"

The most ridiculously cumbersome part of the whole process is registering it onto the network/wifi/password.
The tiny display's icons are confusing and extremely difficult to understand and read.
It's a 'sometimes' printer across my devices and I never know if it will work on my IOS, Android or Windows platforms as it isn't always recognized by all..
The amount of pages printable from your HP ink cartridges are a joke.
I recently updated my devices and based on my experience with this ""printer"" I decided to 'bypass' the HP offerings and purchased a Lenovo Laptop and Tablet.
Looking forward to replacing that HP printer with a more dependable brand."

I did not want to pay to get it professional repaired so I decided to buy a new printer taking when we get something that was pleasant to use. my current printer I find a nuisance and not very user-friendly. I have been able to use it but I find it is way less convenient to use my previous printer. Based on 8020 series I would not recommend it to people. I had a much higher opinion when I had my 8620 printer."

I have to reset it almost every time (98% of the time) I use it to print, and I only print maybe one or two short documents a month.  It takes a long time to reset it also.  I don't like the monthly ink program, especially when you don't need to print often.  I have wanted to throw it out the window of my house many times.  My old $50 wireless printer worked for 12 years, and it was always ready to print.  Will never buy a HP printer again."

I have had multiple interactions with support, but haven’t been able to fix the “margin” issues.  I bought the printer to make centers at home for my kindergarten classroom.  I can’t use it for that reason though because it cuts off the edge of every document no matter how I print."

I think you guys need to get rid of that rule so people can get their work done
381235167,Others,negative,0.9268649220466614,I wish that I had the option of requesting color ink.  I signed up for the ink program and it is claiming that I'm not in need of color ink when in fact I am needing color ink.

So, we decided to buy a new printer and an HP rep was in the store that day and told us about their Smart Tank.  We bought it and haven't had any problems since.  The color is always great!

I was able to use the printer/scanner a couple of times, then it completely stopped working.

I spent a couple of hours troubleshooting, deleting the app, clearing everything and starting over.  Nothing.

381248146,Others,neutral,0.46417856216430664,"For the price range I paid is does a pretty nice job. I like the fact that I can make copies. I'm retired so I do not need to send & receive fax docs. I also like that I don't have to go out & find the right ink cartridge nor shop online for it. Also I like that it does not require a cable to connect to computer. I don't mind HP monitoring it, but I I really don't like leaving any appliance on when I leave the room. One other small thing I would appreciate a little more descriptive panel when selecting my print options. Usually everything goes well from my print selections in the HP dialog box before sending it out to print, however sometimes I've got to get up and push a button to see the x icon which means it's ready to go. I'm really just not a fan of icons without a little written direction. Perhaps that has a lot more to do with being 74. Sure beats going out to FedEx to make copies on complex machines that are changing all the time, or used to since now they are down to one machine after having at least  4 before. I guess HP & other companies have taken market share away from them in that respect. Greg"

I thought I could order online and have it ship but no they wanted you to sign up and pay a monthly subscription,  don't like doing that and because I didn't my print stop and couldn't print.

381656777,Others,negative,0.758328378200531,"I have had HP printers for years and my biggest issue has been related to the HP Instant ink subscription service.  I typically buy a much higher end printer than needed to get some of the additional features, but printing usage it very low, under 100 pages a month typically so a printer rated for 2000 pages a month should last me forever. But the issue is once in a while with past printers I would get locked out because of the instant ink subscription and it typically would require support to get it back online.  Not only does this take a couple of hours or more when this happens, once the printer is more than 2- or 3-years old. support wants to push toward upgrading the printer, which really irritates the hell out of me, since my printer has only printed 2000 pages in that time when it is rated for that per month.  
The last time this happened in November 2023 I decided it was time to upgrade and went with an Epson product after visiting with the manager at the local Office Depot store and explaining my frustration.  The Epson worked fine for 5 months, but last week it did an update and the new driver actually looks the only print from devices on 2.4 Ghz WiFi, this is true even if the printer is connected via CAT5, it simply will not print if my pc is connected to the same subnet on 5 Ghz WiFi. I spoke to support and the tech said that is the way it is designed to work.  And to test it I connected it via CAT5 with my laptop on the 5G WiFi and i would get an error every time. If I switched to the 2.4G WlFi the document would print and error clear.  So back to Office Depot it went under the Satisfaction Guarantee clause. And I am back to the HP with instant ink and hopeful the connection issues are resolved, and I do not have that issue going forward.

Hp's ENVY Pro 6458 received a firmware update rendering it inoperable due to medium levels of ink. HP now demands that all it's printers ink cartridges are always completely full or the machine will not function. Even ink-free processes such as scanning are disabled if anyone does not meet HP's new mandatory ink & paper level, which must be completely full at all times. Due to their unethical, illegal business practices, I've been forced to file a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. The BBB had spoke with HP, and HP's 1st agent I spoke with admitted that I was not supposed to receive the illegal firmware update because I bought my printer before this illegal practice, price gouging, and other offences were quietly snuck into HP's victim's peripheral via unauthorized firmware update. I have now incurred an exponential loss of work, money(from the lost work), mental, emotional, and physical trauma due to this crime. I have Multiple Sclerosis, this hack/scam preventing me from using my HP ENVY Pro 6458 All-in-One Printer had now caused an MS attack. My left side of my body is in pain, especially my left leg and foot.

Historical problems and not resolved despite numerous calls to tech support:
I owned a HP Officejet Pro 8620 for seven years and love it! In 2022, while printing, it asked for the yellow cartridge to be changed. I did this, then, it wanted the cyan cartridge changed. I changed it. Then, “Printer failure. There is a problem with the printer or ink system. Turn printer off, then on. If problem persists, contact HP.”
I turned the printer off/on. Didn’t help. Replace the new cartridges with another set of new cartridges, removed and re-inserted all of the cartridges. Still getting the same error message. Went on-line to tech support and through the diagnostic question process, with, what seemed like a robot. The result was, sorry, we cannot find a solution to your problem.
Checked listed service centers. Staples. Called Staples. They do not fix printers and could only send them back to the factory but only if still on warranty. The printer is 7 years old…not on warranty.
Asked about similar printers in stock and they had an HP Officejet Pro 9025. Went and bought it.
Set it up, went on line to complete the installation, (not an intuitive process by the way). I tested printing, copying and scanning with a word document. It would print and copy but not scan. Need to download some other driver. (The box says print, copy, scan and fax. It should do all of this ‘out of the box’ with just ONE download!)
Went on line again. Found the software. But would not let me download it unless I:
-	Opened an account
-	Signed up for something called HP Smart
-	Signed up for the ink
Did all that (under protest!!)
Driver started to install. Got “stuck” and then message that it could not find the device! What?!
Went into my test word document to check out printing ….. HP 9025 no longer listed in the print window! What?!
Opened control panel and checked list of printers. HP 9025 listed but “no driver installed”! What?!
Noticed another printer listed “HP Smart”. Huh?
Went back to the word document and found HP Smart listed as a printer. Selected it and (yet another) window asking me to confirm printing to the HP 9025. It is the only printer I have connected…it has to ask? Printed OK.
Wondered if the scanning would now work, so selected scan from the printer and yes, it scanned the document and sent it to my computer. However, unlike the 8620, it did not give me an opportunity to select the output format. Opened the scanned document on my computer. JPEG. Hit the drop-down file format menu. TIFF, PNG, no PDF!
So how do I scan as PDF?
All of the above occurred shortly after buying the 9025 in 2022. Since then I have had numerous problems, mostly with scanning, but also with ""off-line"", or ""printer can't be found"" messages. I have made numerous calls to tech support (check my file). For some reason I now have TWO HP 9025s coming up on the list of available printers. One of them says ""copy"" and it is the only one that works. My experience with your tech support people has not been good either. They seem to bumble around, not knowing really how to fix a problem, just shooting in the dark till something sort-of works.
The scanning problem is persistent. When I scan to computer, three devices are listed. One does not provide the PDF option. The second does provide the PDF option, but when I scan I get a message on my computer ""printer not found"", which doesn't make any sense at all since it is the printer sending the message. The third device doesn't work at all. I figured out a work-around for the persistent scanning problem. I scan to a USB as a PDF then manually transfer the scan to my computer. Not ideal but it works."

In the past, they went into effect when the last one stopped. Also, this printer can only print if connected to my PC. What!!! I thought all printers were stand-alone. My PC was down, and I had to meet a deadline. I could still make copies right - wrong. The printer locked up tighter than a drum. Also, this printer is flimsy.

Plus HP really needs to work on the graphics for showing how much ink is left of each color.  I have experienced that the graphics appear to show you have ink in a color.  I would print something and there was not enough for the print job.  Then the next color appears to still have ink but then the very next re run of the original print job runs out again.  This is really frustrating when you are printing with photo paper.  So you waste ink for all the various colors PLUS multiple photo papers.

Next day same bullcrap with the help line through ""messenger"" another 2 hours shot still same error. Cleaned contacts 5-7 times reinstalled the cartridges you provided with the machine. still got the ""E"" error could not access the printer. Then I went to staples got NEW costing me another $45.00 to install and no good. 
Tonight when I finally left my shop I returned home, updated my software on my Mac (not happy with that ether) just so I could use your software.

I followed the directions and I started the instant ink subscription. Then it told me to input a claim code for my free 3 months. but there was no claim code in the box. there was no claim code on the box. there was no claim code on any of the paperwork, not even the pink flyer that said "" 3 free months""  on it there was no code anywhere! I bought a code from Amazon for $5.Now explain to me how $5 equals free! 
3. So the Amazon code worked. Got the printer all set up. And the first 45 pages you print it out perfectly I'll straight up when you look at the app to preview and put it out exactly like that. Then the next page I printed printed upside down and backwards. I wanted it to print in the top right hand corner of the page. But instead it printed in the bottom left hand corner of the page where I already had something printed so that ruined both of those projects. and I have very limited paper! In between a bright pretty page and down and backwards pretty page I had not touched any buttons on my phone or on my printer there was nothing touched to change to position of the page printing! So I called your tech people. 
4. The first tech that I talked to on the night of April 20th was extremely helpful polite and willing to put in whatever time it took to try and fix the problem up to the point to where I was getting too sleepy to keep going! So he set up for a phone call the following date. Well the tech who called me had none of those attributes! He's been very little time trying to assist me and did very little to try and find out what the problem was he kept telling me that the free 3 months trial was automatic with the printer and I did not need to have a code which was wrong because it wouldn't go to the next page without me you putting in a code And then he kept telling me that the upside down printing issue was a problem with the Samsung phone and that I needed to contact Samsung and tell them that it was their issue to deal with it because it was he said it wasn't a printer issue !! I had counted on HP! My dad bought HP printer laptop He's gone now and I still have his HP laptop All of his office electronics were HP so seeing that I assumed it was a quality company! I thought I could count on them to stand behind on what they sold! But I guess you really get what you pay for. I bought my printer on Amazon on a special sale for $35 it's that I had the best deal ever made! Sad she realize that all I bought was a $35 nightmare!"

382507837,Others,negative,0.5398889183998108,"Honestly I think the HP Plus program is criminal, not the ink refill program I think that's great The HP +. Why do I think that? 
 It's because my printer was working fine yesterday while working from home, I'm on a hybrid schedule and work 3 days a week from home, I needed to print multiple documents and a couple of them printed satisfactorily.  As I tried to print one from my phone I used HP Smart, it asked for my PIN number for my printer it's a  HP Office jet pro 8030 I believe. I just purchased at Costco less then 8 months ago. First time I ran out of ink I found some HP ink cartridges at local store and reinstalled them.  They worked fine.  I ran out a second time the HP cartridge run available at my local store so bought some ink off Amazon, wasn't the cheapest I could find, it seemed to be high quality ink, five-star reviews, put it in carts...I received a message that they weren't genuine HP, and I accepted it.  Printer worked fine for days.  Jump to yesterday printed a document worked okay then I need to print one for my phone and here's where the trouble began.  I installed the HP smart app trying to print from my phone and ask me to I put in pin #.... I found the PIN number in the printer and hit okay, then a message abouton the HP + pops up I got ok and now my printer is bricked. I was on the phone for 3 hours yesterday trying to unsubscribe from HP + so I could print important documents for work!  The gentleman created a case number 512-301-3147. I was unable to print important work documents and water hrs of my Friday evening!  As you can imagine it was extremely frustrating.  Though it says if you're not happy with HP Plus you can pause or cancel anytime apparently you cannot. 
Again 3 hours discussing this to me that's criminal acts as my Printer somehow got immediately flashed and now would not print for my phone or my PC.  The min I hit ok on HP+ it flashed my printer to no longer accept the cartridges that were in there and working fine.  I told the employee to cancel it I asked him to ward my avoid my warranty that I didn't care I just needed to print a document I was transferred to another gentleman nobody would cancel my HP Plus membership I asked if I could delete my HP account and create a new one and reboot my printer he was of zero help there essentially told me there's no way it's impossible to cancel which I don't believe to be the case due to the verbiage in the agreement and the fact that it's a method of HP locking customers to use their ink, which again I actually prefer HP ink and would have bought it didn't have it available at the store You can understand how frustrating this is.  Eventually I put in the empty old HP carts. 
 The resulting printed documents looked horrible but it was my only choice again after 3 hours of conversation. I've had five HP laptops, HP desktops.  My current JP Envy 360 convertible I thought was a great computer aside from it's unbalanced weight, my previous DV6 again thought was a great computer, My last HP printer worked great, but I tell you 100%, that at this point I'll never buy an HP product again. Now, apparently my case hasn't reached full resolution after our 3-hour conversation and resetting the printer three times I still couldn't get it to print anything again and the high quality aftermarket carts had ben working fine.  I completely understand you want everyone to buy your ink and it could void the warranty, but it was a $200 printer I would happily buy another one getting these documents printed was much more important in 3 hours of my time worth much more than $200.  
After digging through your pages and during this 3-hour conversation I found a statement that there's no added cost to sign up for HP Plus. You just need to own supported HP printer and use genuine HP ink or toner. Plus if you decide you aren't delighted with HP Plus, you can change, pause, or cancel it at any time at no cost."". Well apparently my computer printer has been flashed with some type of software that your employees are unable to remove and I now have a paperweight until I can find some HP ink which at this point I refuse to do. I even asked a gentleman just to send me a few ink cartridges overnight so I could print them the following morning and regrettably he would not do so I guess we'll see where my case goes but my current plan is when I have my garage sale in May to sell all my HP products and head back to Costco to purchase new printer new laptop new desktop etc. Not even sure if you guys read these things but that's my story"

This HP Printer is so much better and ""USER FRIENDLY"" and I had it up and running in no time flat which was absolutely amazing as I thought I was going to have to figure it out over the whole weekend....lol.....I remember going on Youtube often to try to figure how to use certain functions that should be easy but was so FRUSTRATING to do when using my older HP Printer. I even had to use Printer cable with the old printer after awhile to get it working properly to print even though it was hooked up to my Wifi...could never figure out what the problem was?...This NEW HP Printer (Model 2755e ) was so easy to set up compared to the one that I used to have that was just a couple of years old.....The price is great and affordable for many people and I also think that your Printer cartridges are also a good price so I thought I will see how it goes again owning another HP Printer and I have to say that this was a great experience  compared to my older Hp Printer that was purchased in 2022...Since I am a Senior now I need it to be as easy as possible (a no- brainer...lol) to set up and use.   Thank you for the great improvements by making is way MORE User Friendly in every way...as there is no comparison to the older 2022 HP Printer (2700 series) that I used to own !!  Linda Reynolds"

382655845,Others,negative,0.7140358090400696,"Printers don't need to be this complicated.  You didn't supply a cord to connect to older computers that don't have WiFi abilities and I'm NOT paying a monthly fee and then be limited to how many pages I can print, or pay a fee even if I don't use up those pages.  I'll buy my ink as I need it.  If I knew all of this, I wouldn't have gone with it.

Also, the top document feeder isn't working too well, there is no instructions to tell you to place the document face up or face down, you have to figure it out.

It also doesn't tell you which top corner to line up your scanner glass scans.

Overall, the printer doesn't live up to my expectations.  The ""alignment"" page didn't copy and print as clearly as the original, which does not bode well for scans that I need to print out.

I'm retired now, live on social security only and one month I might print two pages, next month I might print 200.  (Unlikely, but it could happen).

The printhead finally died and rather than replace it (it doesn’t like my 5G wifi - I don’t think that existed when it was new), I got a new HP 9125e which seems to be the closest replacement for the features I need. I note that it is much less robust (fine, saving weight and plastic - although the paper tray is definitely flimsy and does not seem to securely hold 8.5 x 11” paper). I’m trying the Instant Ink free 3 month trial but so far the experience is not great. I know that ink is the profit center for printers and they are sold at or near cost to create demand for ink. HP is getting pretty heavy handed here and that is a bit disturbing: 1. You are blocking competing ink suppliers by chipping the cartridges and further obligating new Instant Ink customers to promise to NEVER use other ink suppliers AND telling us that is we cancel the subscription, you will incapacitate the cartridges - talk about big brother! 2. I set my new printer to turn off at night to save power and be a tiny bit greener. HP said it couldn’t communicate with my printer and sent an email telling me to never turn off the printer or disconnect it from the internet. This again sounds very invasive and anti-conservation. There is no need to monitor my device constantly. Having it check in once a day sounds like it would be plenty. I’m starting to regret taking advantage of your “free” offer and wondering if I should reduce the likelyhood of recommending HP to others. BTW, I always used genuine HP ink in my old printer without coercion or threats. I thought it was the best thing for me. Your recent actions give me pause. I hope you will reconsider your attitude to your customers and encourage them to use your products because they are better and more affordable rather than using a stick."

My printer connected to a wireless card on my desktop over Bluetooth due to the  proximity of my desktop.  Luckily I have an IT back ground in desktop support so connecting laptops/PCs to printers was just a matter of troubleshooting the issue after 2 hours, I was getting a little frustrated, but having patience is part of my job. 

A friend of mine however, had a similar issue with one of your new HP inkjet wireless printers, which she purchased this year, she was so frustrated when she asked me to help, she was going to return the print device.  After 2 hours, I finally, had to download software from the HP support website and connect a USB cable from her printer to her laptop.  Only after this, we were able to have the laptop communicate with the printer.   So first thing you need to do is fix the wireless issue.  You will lose sales if you don't.  Better instructions should be included especially what possible cables may be needed, to complete setup.  I know you asked about my printer but there are older people that don't necessarily have an IT background and they will return the equipment rather than trying to understand an offshore technician over the phone.    

My printer once I got it connected works well, whether I use my phone, tablet, desktop, and laptop. It uses hardly any ink for even the most color graphic print outs.  Very economical, if someone tells me they are considering buying another printer and they're even thinking about an inkjet, I tell them to consider a tank printer.  My last printer was an HP Officejet that lasted for 7 years.  I originally paid $100 for it brand new out of the box.  The after costs in buying ink cartridges, probably brought my ""$100"" to a ""$1,100"" printer.   

The tank printer is a little more expensive, up front cost but I was willing to pay as much as $275 for a printer.  I know I would have already paid $120 in ink if I had purchased the inkjet.  My tank printer has just recently got to the point were, I can see the level of ink in the ink display windows.  I figure I will need in maybe late Dec 2025 or early Feb 2026."

So, I bought this 4152e, thinking it would be quite similar, but smaller. Have been disappointed that it is more ""fiddly"" than the 7810. I figured HP would have upped its game in the intervening years, not backed off its excellence.
Replacement ink cartridges were not the same size as originals. Did not know that was OK. Was afraid the extra length would jam the printer, and could not find online assurance that things were OK.
Difficult to load paper. Proper alignment difficult to discern, but I think I have it learned now.
Sometimes I can find how to see ink levels, sometimes not. Where is that handy-dandy desk-top icon that leads to such info? The ""everything is intuitive once you learn how to do it"" rule seems to be in effect much too often, though I have used HP printers for decades. It is slow to present print controls onscreen, and goes through too many iterations of having to tell it to print, one of which will search for the printer connection forever, until I tell it to print anyway.
It eventually prints OK, but I am always uncertain that it will, when I need it to.
Scanning controls difficult to find, but work when I do find them."

Secondly I assumed that the printer I ordered would be able to do duplex printing. I ordered the all in one because it had a document feeder. Duplex printing should be a given as it saves paper. I’m also disappointed that there is no way to view the printer configuration on my laptop…way too dumbed down for my taste.
I did exchange the printer for an Envy model which supports duplex printing but doesn’t have a document feeder.

I use a Brother inkjet with a XL toner cartridge I installed in 2015 (it's now 2024) and it's still printing fine. Occasionally I use the HP to print something in color and here's the funny thing, these cartridges at approx $75 per pack deplete in the printer even if you don't use them! Seriously the levels are all low (the cyan empty so now it won't print) and I may have printed 20 sheets since the last $75 new cartridges install. Why would sealed cartridges that are installed in the printer deplete without printing?!? This has happened since I bought this printer. It's really the worst scam in computer peripherals."

Research shows that HP has changed their 950/951 cartridges and don't seem to care that they no longer fit older printer models. I heard that they've also made it harder (firmware updates) to use other brands. Maybe filling the old cartridges is the only way. But reviews on these kits are not encouraging.

Cannot download HPsmart+
Eventually did it on my phone but want to be able to print from my computer

The disgraceful manner in which HP attempt to impose the use of their invisible ink shows HP is sinking below their once decent standards.
The functionality of the Envy6000 is superficially poorer than my old Envy4527 that it replaced.  With the latter I could choose to 'scan' using an onboard command.  Now I have to log onto HP Smart.  The absence of an onboard screen is a backward step."

Hi Dusan,

I have found the case number from Tech support in January which is 5119517831 and whoever your colleague was i spoke too from instant ink in January, to told me that he had put a note on to add an additional three months onto the nine months free giving me a total of 12months for the inconvenience.

As i explained to him at the time, i replaced the instant cartridge with a new one and my printer had an error saying cartridge jam or words to that effect and when i spoke to tech support they told me the printer had failed and was broken so i purchased the new printer but just before i was about to set up the new printer i tried the faulty one and found it had started working again so when i called technical support again he apologised for telling me the old printer was faulty so giving me the extra 3 months, although i wasn't very happy about it as i had just purchased a new printer for over £180.00 when i didn't have too and i tried to send it back to the company where i purchased it but they would not accept it back due to me opening the box.

Hope this helps and gets resolved.

Regards
Tom wright"

On top of all of that, the printer still does not work! On Friday morning I was told to return it to the supplier & that I would get an email to give to them explaining why. As no email had arrived I contacted the Support centre again - only to be told not to do this, but to wait as the issue had been escalated.
In addition, I have received emails (no-reply, which really does not help!) telling me that my case has been closed as you have not had any further contact with me. 
The latest person I spoke with told me that I have a new case number & this is still being worked on. 
Another person this morning told me the problem was with the printer cartridge. This has not been mentioned previously & the cartridge I have was bought with the printer & is an HP cartridge. Also, I fail to see why a faulty printer cartridge would affect the printer being ""seen"" by my laptop.

In addition, as soon as I bought it, I had a lot of printing to do, so I printed a lot and used a lot of color ink, so I ordered instant HP ink, but I don't know what that means because there was no proper instructions as to whether the ink would come to my house right away or 3 months later. I think the Instant HP Ink ordering page needs to be re-created from the buyer's perspective. The current instant HP ink ordering screen appears to have been created from the perspective of HP company employees.

The customer rep said her name was Fe.  She was extremely responsive, professional and friendly and shared a wealth of information. We had quite a lengthy 'Chat.' She was also very knowledgeable. Having my old printer stop working correctly - the 7640 series - was a major disappointment for me.  I've had it for years and loved it.  I shared this with Fe and she sent me some links that might be helpful in trying to figure out what went wrong with my old printer.

384907089,Others,negative,0.8504772782325745,"When I bought us a new HP printer back in late 2022 or early '23, I had no idea at the time the whole thing was going to turn into what for my wife and I essentially has been a huge, stress-inducing nightmare! Here's the deal: We're retired and I'm now disabled and basically no longer able to get around, so just getting over to and/or moving our printer around at all (my wife has to help me with that kind of thing) is a major undertaking. Still, when the print quality started going downhill late last year, my wife let me know about it and I knew it was about time to order more ink cartridges.Not being an emergency, we weren't in any big hurry, but days or maybe even weeks later, it was time to make the effort to get over to our home office area and take care of it. My wife grabbed my crutches and gave them to me so I could get up and over to my walker, then I made my way over to our little home office area, seated myself, fired up the PC, got online and set out to replace the failing ink cartridges. Hmm, it had been a little while since I'd used the thing myself, so I didn't remember what model it was, so I reached over and used the little touchscreen controls on the front to check the settings, which told me it was a Hewlett Packard 8020. Great! I got back on the desktop, logged in to and shopped around online until finally deciding I liked one third-party set (with an overwhelming majority of good (mostly five star) ratings at Amazon.com) and went ahead and ordered them, which was a little less expensive than HP cartridges. As usual, they arrived quickly and without incident in just a day or two, but the printer still printed, so we set them aside until the ink we still had left totally ran out. It really got very little use: my wife and I both were career programmers, so for us, computers were just another tool, and we didn't really use our desktop for entertainment at all, unless maybe the TV zonked out, so it was awhile before replacement proved absolutely necessary. No problem (ha!). Anyway, when I finally decided to install the replacements, which proved to be pretty difficult for me, we were both totally shocked when the printer wouldn't even fully start up, telling me on the touch-screen it would not use the cartridges because they weren't HP (which we knew already!). What the heck? I rechecked everything, online and off, but I couldn't figure it out (at first), other than no matter what I tried, the printer refused to even try using them (although it DID recognize they were all full)! They just wouldn't work, so finally I admitted defeat and tried to go through the Amazon refund process. Nope, that's not happening either! By now it had been more than 30 days since I placed the order and no refund was possible. The reason for that was stupidly simple: we didn't waited until the accursed device wouldn't print at all before ordering more, and it turned out to be longer than expected before we had to! So, after receipt, naturally we waited until we had to change them (my wife and I can't afford to waste money), but that put us outside the Amazon 30-day window to ask for a refund we didn't even know about... What a mess! Okay, so now what? Obviously, we needed still more ink cartridges, which made me angry about having wasted our money on the first replacements, so I got back online and logged in at Amazon again. Time for another huge shock: while double checking everything to make sure I would get something that WOULD work, now I discovered that the ratings for these cartridges had changed for the worse, to the extent that even though more than 50% were still five star reviews, now about 44% were ONE star reviews, all of which stated it was because the printer refused to try using them! This sure smells like a scam to me -- somebody is making a lot of money, and it sure isn't us! Was it HP, because the printer wants ONLY HP cartridges now, or was it the third-party sellers, selling products that wouldn't work but couldn't be returned? Now I really was mad; I always check rating percentages before ordering anything, and at the time of this order, most were glowing five star reviews. Now though, a couple of months later, almost half were one star reviews! What the heck happened!?!?Oh well, basically it didn't matter now. So, with nothing else to be done, I decided to just admit and accept defeat, calm down, and figure out how to order something that WILL work. Instead of relying on what I'd found in my printer settings, this time I went back to our original order detail and discovered the printer was NOT an 8020 model, but an 8025e model, which was NOT supported by the cartridges I'd ordered! Well, now I knew, but why did the printer software tell me it was a 8020? After using a search engine to examine some online photos of HP printers, my wife came over and disconnected everything so she could move the printer around enough to discover the name and model number printed on the lower right side of the front panel, which we couldn't see from the desk. Yep: 8025e. Wow... Why did the onboard software (and what showed up in the desktop PC printer queue or softwareOkay, time to wrap this up before I blow a gasket. After CONSIDERABLE research, I finally ordered what I believed to be exactly what we needed, making sure all of it really was made by Hewlett Packard (one large black cartridge and three standard, smaller color cartridges cost nearly ONE HUNDRED BUCKS, when the stuff I'd ordered before had been under fifty (!!!), and obviously at that time WORKED for the majority of users, most of whom crowed about the money they'd saved!!! ARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!). Hold up now -- deep breath -- get a grip, dude... ;-) Well, we'll know by tomorrow night.

It was HP ink, not altered any way. Along the way, I replaced the ink with the one HP sent. When my free trial ended, I was not going to remain in the ink program because I have never used more than one cartridge of each color a year….ever in my life. I canceled. I then read HPs cancellation policy that the ink you sent would stop working….I only made about 10 copies, so the ink was full.
If I had known this, I would have installed yours and when it was used up, I would have put mine back in. So, now I am on the pause program and when that expires the cartridges will be about 75% full. I would never tell anyone to join your program if they don’t print enough."

The way we've been treated by the team that manages the HP instant ink solution is beyond disgusting and has left an extremely bad taste in our mouth with your company, not only do we or will we not ever purchase another printer from HP again, we also severely boycott all HP products including scanners, computers, laptops, etc. 

We are firm believers and also sharing the negative feedback and activity with as many people as we can. This includes our agents and associates who are former writers and reporters. One of their reputations is great on both the Google and other network of reviews. He has received well over 500,000 views as a very popular reviewer. He alone has written over 10 reviews, very negative reviews of your products experience. Yes we have own numerous printers from your company and because of how you manage The instant ink program We will never buy another printer again mostly because it is wasted so much time and energy dealing with the negativity and the angst of trusting HP and then realizing it was just a scam, never again. Personally I know at least a dozen people that we have prevented from becoming an HP customer. 

Hopefully one day HP will learn from this mistake and try to fix it. We have found many many similar stories online. We as a company take this very very seriously which is why we are so very passionate about sharing this type of horrible experience with others so they also do not experience and go through what we had to."

The replacement did not have any ink cartridges but being a member of instant ink I thought no problem and installed the cartridges from the defective printer into the replacement printer. BUT THE PRINTER REJECTED THEM AS BEING INITIALLY INSTALLED IN A DIFFERENT PRINTER AND THE PRINTER WOULD NOT PRINT. I worked with tech support for over an hour, but the printer continued to refuse to use my cartridges, This is one of the stupidest things I ever saw-almost as bad as my first delivery of instant ink cartridges earlier this year just after I bought the original 76900e  where the black cartridge was defective and I had to re-order and wait a week or two to get useable ink cartridges.

But when I tried to scan and copy it to complete the process, nothing. The page prints with no ink, black or color. After doing every diagnostic I could think of (clearing smear, resetting to default settings), it printed black-only erradically (the first few lines looked good but the rest of the lines on the page were faded or smudged). After 3 tries at troubleshooting, I wondered if the cartridge itself was the problem. So I replaced it with the 2nd package that I had on hand. It printed perfectly, color and black, just as it should.So, the one package of cartridges was a dud.

385605980,Others,negative,0.5998224020004272,"It took three weeks to set up this printer.  It printer instructions make certain assumptions that may not be true in every case.  In the case of this printer, HP assumed that a wireless set up was possible.  However, my printer is located in my office in the kitchen, and the router is at least 35 or 40 feet away in an upstairs closet.  It is not possible to move either one.

My old printer was hardwired to my old computer via ethernet.  Your online instructions suggest that this is a possibility for HP Officejet8015e, so I went to Best Buy to buy an ethernet cable and a converter--$50.  I brought them home, only to find that this particular printer doesn't have an ethernet port.

Because I could find no further instructions from HP (and because I am really not a fan of ""chats""), I made an appointment with Best Buy Geek Squad (more money), loaded up my printer, cables, laptop, etc. and went to the store.  They found the necessary cable for hardwire to be a simple USB (only $8.00).  Because your instructions at Hp.123.com insist that I need to download drivers, I asked them to do that for me in store.  Surprise!  The hardwire connection doesn't require the drivers--even the Geek Squad tech didn't know that!

I set up the whole thing at home, and asked to SCAN a document to my computer.  More surprises.  The hardwire allows only printing.  To use any other function on the printer, I had more hoops to jump through.  

CONCLUSION:  While I can now use all the functions I need, this setup was unnecessarily frustrating because of inadequate instructions on your part due to your beginning with unfounded assumptions about every homeowner's router/printer proximity.  This is a simple fix on your part, but until it IS fixed, I would not recommend this particular printer.

A second unrelated assumption on your part is that people working on laptop computers will be willing to sit at a desk hardwired to their printers so that you can gather information about how much ink they use and when to send more.  This is just unrealistic.  I don't know about you, but I work outside on a pretty day and in my easy chair on a bleak one."

385749822,Others,negative,0.6427724957466125,The printer doesn't have a tray that juts out. This was very useful for under-counter positioning. The printer has been very reliable for the most part. The only exception was a firmware update that caused the printer to stop working and forced me to roll back and not allow automatic updates. The cartridges are also very expensive. Previous similar HP Printers have failed almost simultaneously and that makes me suspect that there is an element of built in obselescence. I wasn't keen on the height of the scanner sheet feed which makes it difficult to position the printer right up against a wall. Overall I always choose an HP printer.

When I opened 1 corner of the box to remove the Ink, it was leaking everywhere. I had it stored in a lock & lock box that is air proof & water proof. There was a small piece of black plastic MISSING off of the cartridge I noticed after Inspecting it. I installed the cartridge anyway to see if it would work, after I patted the outer cartridge dry from leaking black ink. The copier refused it saying it was a ""Supply Issue"". Printer said to install a different black cartridge. I didn't have another one. I removed broken one & reinstalled it, but the printer refused it again. This was obviously a manufacturers defect. It has been over 3 months so I knew I wouldn't get any refund. I threw away $51+ in trash. Thankfully Amazon can deliver next day. I do appreciate the fact that Amazon sells the ink I need. I wish HP would restart their recycling program for their ink cartridges. It breaks my heart to throw empties in regular garbage that goes to the dump.
