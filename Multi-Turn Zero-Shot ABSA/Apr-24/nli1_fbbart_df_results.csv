When the agent set this up,  he said I would have 2 years warranty instead of one. Yet, on my dashboard on your website, it says I have 11 months and 17 days remaining. I set the printer up on Mar 26, 2024. I should have 23 months and 17 days remaining. In addition, the paperwork that came with my printer said that I could enroll in HP +/Instant Ink for 100 pages@$5.99/mo.

In the email you sent me today, it states I've printed 82 pages in this billing cycle. Regardless, I signed up for the 100 page, NOT the 50. And which price IS it? And why does my account say I'm not even enrolled in this ink/paper program, while another place on your website says I AM?

I literally have to restart my entire computer to get rid of it from my task tray and shut it down. I requested someone to call me - it was supposed to be around 10 minutes - and that was over 30 minutes ago. So no, at this point, I'm not too happy of a camper. I like the printer, although it sucks ink up like a sponge, but I can't say I'm happy with HP itself, since you seem to be all over the place in what you're saying I'm supposed to be buying for a specific price.

No jam was. found, and despite my carefully following all the cleaning routines recommended on your support website, it would not restart. So this is in keeping with the possibility that you have built this product not to last much longer than your 1-year guarantee. The only reason I have replaced the failed unit with the same model is that I had taken out a 3 year support agreement with Curry's, who confirmed the ""paper jam without any paper - and without roller debris"", and replaced the failed unit.
The Currys support agreement continues. The first unit failure occurred on the FIRST time I had to replace a cartridge, so I will be interested in how long the new unit lasts, and whether it survives a cartridge exchange. 
Having written this, I ask myself why I am giving you a 5! Probably only for ease of installation, the device driver, and the web support facility."

This printer was replacing a older, similar HP multi-function device (about 5 years old that just quit and wouldn't power on). I had to delete the HP Smart App, re-install it and start over to get it to connect to the new printer. The biggest frustration was with inserting the printer cartridges. Despite pressing them in as hard as I thought reasonable for fear of damaging something, they kept popping out. It took at least 20 minutes and a half dozen attempts to finally get the cartridges to stay in place. I also had some difficulty getting the scanning feature to work. I played around with it for about 15 minutes and it started working but I have no idea why it wouldn't work initially or what I did to finally resolve the problem. I'm using the printer connected to my home network with an ethernet cable so I don't have any opinion on the ease of setting up the WiFi connection or performance over WiFi.

The second reason was I paid monthly for ink but the ink wouldn’t show up on time, at the time I finally said enough was enough was when I was out for a month but never received ink.

I will never buy another HP product unfortunately due to this awful experience."

If you decide to go with HP+, you can never ""undo"" that decision. And you have to decide that before you ever use the printer, use HP+ or its features, etc. It feels forced. If you were confident in your products, you'd allow people time to come to an informed decision, either by being able to add HP+ at any time down the line, or by allowing folks to cancel without any permanent penalty. If you decide later you don't like HP+, you basically have to buy a new printer, which is total BS.

(2) Information was inconsistent. Is the Instant Ink free trial 3 months or 6 months? Found references to both numbers in both the printed information that came with the printer, the information displayed during setup, and the confirmation emails (e.g. after setting up Instant Ink for 3 months, the ""welcome to HP+"" email said I'd get 6 months -- and even later in this very survey it says 6 months!). Same thing with the prices of Instant Ink, which were one number in the materials, but then a higher number when you actually go to set it up. These were obviously changes that were made at some point that have not been updated everywhere. This doesn't inspire confidence in your attention to detail, and makes an impression that you're just trying to make as much money as possible off the ink and monthly services, with the printer itself feeling like an afterthought. I wonder if you don't want to go totally to the cell phone model and just own that your real business is now ink & paper with a monthly subscription fee, and make the printer free with e.g. a 12-mo commitment."

376225564,Product Quality,negative,0.5521543025970459,"Overall, one the printer was finally set up it works great. Getting to the set up was a horrible experience. We ordered the printer and 2 back up packages of ink replacements 3/14/24. It arrived the following Monday. I began to set it up on Tuesday 3/19/24 and it did not work. I got print system errors telling me that the ink cartridges were leaking and to check them and if leaking contact HP and if not reinstall and restart. They were not leaking so I went with that option. Still the error occurred. After an hour of trying on my own, I contacted HP support. They tried to help and had me do everything they could think of to solve the problem and then had me open a BRAND NEW pack of ink and go that route, still did not work. So now I have opened and wasted 2 packages of ink. They tell me they believe it is a faulty print head and that they will be issuing me a new one. Ok, fine. However they did not mention that they old one needed to be sent back, it was not a big deal but just an irritation that I now needed to go to FedEx at the end of a long day. It took a week for the print head to get here. I had to reach out and tell them that our shipping department closes at 2:30 and since it was Friday we are not open on the weekend it will need to now wait until Monday to be delivered, so now we are looking at 3/25/24. 11 days after the original printer was ordered. A week after the original printer was received. The print head was not the solution, I installed it and used the set up ink that came with it and it did not work. I reached out to support and after an hour and a half of chat and videos they decided they would replace the printer. So I ask what the procedure is. They need a $1 collateral in case we don't send it back, ok fine. ""When will it be here"" they tell me by April 10. April 10th?!?!? That is not ok. I tell them that is not ok it needs to be here sooner, they tell me they can get it here by the end of the week for $25 more. I tell them ""no that will not work. Do not process this. I want to speak with a supervisor"". I never heard from one. I called the next day 3/26/24, at this point I am very upset. The printer was faulty out of the box through no fault of ours and we would have to pay more to get it here sooner? that is not right, that should have been on HP. Had the printer worked like it should have I would have had a working printer 3/18/24, but if I didn't want to pay additional money I had to wait over 3 weeks to get a working printer? In what world is that right when the customer did nothing wrong? In the end HP came to their senses and did not charge us the extra shipping and did ship overnight. Then came the FedEx issue. We are a manufacturing warehouse, so our hours are earlier than most and our shipping and receiving dock closes at 2:30 pm. I got the notification that it was going to be delivered by 10:40 am, i thought ""no problem"" then I got "" its delayed and will be there by 8pm"" well obviously that does not work. I called HP and they told me to call FedEx. The first day it was fine since it wasn't on a truck yet. The 2nd day however, it was on a truck and they could not do anything since HP does not allow FedEx to change anything. So I called HP back and they would not help me. Once the new one came, there was no set up ink that came with it, well it requires new, unused ink. so I had to open my last thing of ink. Overall, I spent over 5 hours on support with agents, I called HP at least 4 times, FedEx at least 3 times, emailed HP 3 times, and have opened all the ink I bought as spare ink. I have used HPs my entire life, in fact when researching printers for our business I made the decision for this printer because of the brand and I am feeling highly disappointed. I now have to spend at least another $130 to get more spare ink."

The liquid ink was an issue as I have a tremble in my hands and I am always spilling stuff and I was horrified if I could even do that simple task but with the directions on the printer and the book it was a smoother process. I
I would like to know how to select black and white printing when the need arises?
 I haven’t delved too far into how to find that directional information on the printer menu. 
I had problems when my Mac laptop tried to print to my HP Smart Tank as it kept bringing up the old HP that wasn’t on WiFi and so each agonizing time I printed I would select my HP Smart Tank over it so got though that now I try to print just what I need and don’t overly print. 
I just have a nack with old HP and Canon copiers and printers as I have two that continue to fight the odds and will work so I still use them for black and white and color as I need to use their ink cartridges up. 
The problem I see down the road is when should I fill the liquid ink sections when they are half full or before and as it’s been awhile I hope I can do that seamlessly like when I first took the plunge.

Hewlett Packard
1501 Page Mill Rd MS 1247
Palo Alto, CA 94301-1112

Dear Hewlett Packard (HP) Complaints Representative,

I am contacting you because I am thoroughly disgusted with the amount of problems I have encountered with HP since leaving Dell Computers and Printers.

Recently while attempting to switch printers from my ENVY 6400 series to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 for my home-office, I was told something that was very disturbing for me. I was told in an email HP Instant Ink that they could not cancel my subscription until after the next billing cycle on April 29, 2024, nor could I return the unused (still in shipping package), for my ENVY 6400 series even though they are still in the packet they were received in. 

Because of my age (87 years old) and in that category that has never been trained how to do certain things on a computer, I subscribe to the HP Smart Friend at a monthly cost of $16.99 per month. For the most part, that is working out for me, however, when I am transferred to two or three departments for the same thing, that does not bode well for me, and mainly they are asking me to perform the same procedures the person I was transferred from had me do. I was told that I could return my tempted cartridges for recycling, or donate the unopened and unused cartridges to charity in more than 60 countries. Territories and regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North and South America through the HP Planet Partners program. What an insult!

I have so many case numbers that I cannot count them, however, the latest one is: 5122040597 and it was only to install my HP Office Jet Pro 9015 Series printer, cancel the Instant Ink Cartridges, and transfer my subscription to my HP Office Jet Pro 9015. I am trying to remember how long and how many transfers I had to go through to make that transition. And to add insult to injury, I received an email welcoming me to HP’s Paper Add-on Service 1. I have never ordered paper nor do I plan to order paper, I will continue purchasing where I have purchased for over forty years.

Corporations like HP and greedy stockholders are doing everything within their power to drive America into bankruptcy at a high rate of speed, by contracting everything to individuals or companies outside of the Continental United States of America.

Well let me tell you it wasn't my computer as soon as you guys now need money for me so that I can keep getting instant ink from you well let me tell you my computer and my printer work perfectly fine without you hook to it now I'm printing out every page that needs to be printed out instead of every other one so thanks for your business but I wouldn't recommend you to somebody I didn't like dude the fact that you wouldn't even try to help me figure out why the fuck that my printer was printing out every other page and so due to that fact have a good day hope that you have a successful career in instant ink but not with me goodbye

Never set up the instant ink initially as issues with the HP app. After a period of time used the hp app again and was prompted to download another hp plug in app.    Printer still showed in the app as 'some features unavaliable.' Warrenty has expired so could not speak to anyone without purchasing support. What seemed to be a potentially dodgy  'community' support, wasn't worth trying as responses may well be incorrect. The issue being instant ink button in the app just gave a white screen with a circle.Finally after uninstalling the HP app, resetting the printer, wife logging in. The instant ink button somehow functioned but could not finish enrollment as 'printer not connected' got stuck in a cycle trying to connect. Been through various virtual chats, no assistance and feedback given. Have been given HP+ not sure why/how, tried finding out when instant ink free trial expires, put through various Internet tabs, commuicated with someone eventually, thought this may have been due to HP+ but they explained they were US support not UK. Phone number given, but outside hours (same as previous day when I tried to call) what's app chat started, no response. After sorting out issues myself with no support, just a lot of frustration and wasted time. I just want to see when my free trial of instant ink will expire? HP+ email says I get 6months free, printer says I get 6months ( but this should have been done within 7 days), I have a screen shot of one of the mases of tabs I have open saying 30/6/24 but when I loggin to the app and then directed to instant ink no mention of the free trial. Printer good, HP smart app OK for use with the printer, useless for everything else as you get re-directed to Internet pages, disjointed opens a tab nearly ever time you click on anything. How I got US support when you have all my details I do not know. Thanks for reading."

377201082,Others,neutral,0.39100098609924316,"The question isn't how much I enjoy my printer but how likely I am to recommend HP.... And my answer is reflective of that. I think HP does a great job with their computers and printers and I have used their products for decades. I have great confidence in their product line. It's really 5050 whether or not I would recommend the product line to a friend or someone else because of how relative or not relative HP is in today's marketplace. 

I enjoy my printer but the hiccups relating to ink cartridges and their cost, instruction manuals and troubleshooting issues are so clouded and confusing because of the bajillion model numbers and various models when it comes to honing in on an issue. I had an issue with my HP printer connecting to my phone and mobile devices in order to print from remote locations for my job. When that feature worked well I loved my printer. When my printer wasn't available or there were issues with ink levels and other minor operational hiccups, I was livid. But that is true for any computer product from any company these days. There's not enough simple clarified instructions to operate your equipment especially senior citizens. 

If someone were to ask me about an HP computer or printer they were looking at I would encourage them to buy before buying overseas or buying Samsung. I don't have a comment on why I feel that way. You make your assumptions. 

I have an HP laptop and it is awesome. I have an HP all-in-one table top and I enjoy that as well until it became irrelevant out of date and no longer able to use like I did. I find that to be compelling and also frustrating when a consumer spends $800 on a computer setup and 5 years later it's obsolete. But that seems true for all computers and companies.

All around HP screwed up. I’m both your monthly service and your technical support. The printer is in the trash. And I will never buy anything with HP on it again."

This shows me that your priorities are not to get better as a company and try to compete in the market space but to rig things just so that you can figure out how to cheat the customer. This protectionism mentality is what makes great things come to an end because you waste your time in protection while your competitors continue to put their efforts into improving things. You shouldn't be so complacent with your thoughts and shouldn't be so scared of competition as competition is what makes companies get better. Your ink is too expensive and it's because your greedy as a company and that will be your down fall. I know you'll look at your sales and how much profit you make and chalk up my comments as someone that just doesn't understand, but you'll see over time if you don't change your mind set and embrace competition and work to improve rather than just use your size as a company to try and oppress other companies."

I went with to Brother with a toner cartridge instead of ink.

The next day the HP Smart program popped up again, so I installed the printer driver again and took advantage of the HP ink program.  I lived to regret that the next day when the printer stopped working again.  I have now connected it directly again.

Furthermore, you end up paying more for ink cartridges for low-level print jobs because the ink dries up quicker and they must be replaced more often. I believe these are deceptive practices.

Decided to go the Smart Tank route this year to cut back on the insane prices and limited ink content you get with cartridges. Time will tell how well this printer will perform, but as far as putting ink in the ink wells, that was a breeze and no drips anywhere. The tanks and caps are well designed and appear to be of high quality to protect the ink from drying. Set up was a piece of cake. I watched a couple of You Tube Unbox and Set up videos and then just used the Smart App. The App is a great feature, well layed out, very helpful and takes all the guess work out of doing it right the first time.

Not that I don't like them, they are just more expensive then off brand cartridges that indicate they are HP compatible. Seems like this is just a money maker for HP when other cartridges are more or less the same. It would be like any other manufacture that forces you to use their brand where they can control the price and make the end user pay the cost. I tell you what, why don't you have you and all your employees buy name brand precriptions and their elevated high costs instead of moving to generics, which are just as good 99% of the time."

Because of this we decided not to continue with the top up ink service .
To add to the disappointment once we had opted out of this service EARLY I might add before the free 1 year ink we should of had we were unable to use the ink you had supplied.
So with that ,the constantly having to reconnect to internet and wasting lots of paper as it would lose connection half way through printing something the printer sits dormant.
I would not recommend this printer to anyone."

I’m waiting for my ink a long time after ordering it. Barely any details about what was coming in the post or when it will arrive. 
The advice and links in the emails don’t match the processes. The email says ‘follow these steps to track shipment’ the process is non existent so you can’t until you get a tracking code in a notification, that’s the only way to track not the way the email says via your account. 

Simply update the website and separate your countries."

While there is a user manual available, a typical user may not always refer back to it when needed. Additionally, the design is not user-friendly for older individuals.

Furthermore, the product quality is low. The printer I recently purchased broke down and I experience paper jams frequently. It seems that HP printers tend to break down within a couple of years. As a long-time user and supporter of the company, I used to associate HP with reliability and quality. I own an HP monitor and laptop too.

HP Ink:

 I recently cancelled my instant ink and these are the cartridges with remaining ink. 

I used ‘instant ink’  because it was offered with a promotion on a purchase of a new printer. 

When I realized I wasn’t using the amount of ink that would make it worth my while I decided to cancel. 

It was the end of the trial and when I called it was a holiday, Good Friday, March 29, 2024.  I didn’t realize I would have to return the cartridges and that my printer would no longer work until I replaced them with store bought cartridges until I went to print the paper work from the cancellation. No stores open on Good Friday.

The agent could have made that more clear really.

I did get new cartridges the next day so no big deal really. 

In the beginning they sent me one set of cartridges and I was to replace the ones in the machine that had come with it.  They weren’t barely used but you had sent me new cartridges so  I sent them in the recyclable return envelope provided. I thought that was the deal. I guess I could have kept them as they came with the machine. Then I would have been able to use the printer after cancelling instant ink. 

So I was shocked that you wanted the ‘instant ink’ back as I had only used 1/4 of them by the end of the free period. The only set of cartridges I received for the whole free period time.. I thought that was pretty poor for you to take them back not completely used but on thinking about it further they are coded to be able to see when I need ink so I kind of understand now about that. Still I was very surprised that you would need them back. 

In conclusion I have been pretty satisfied with the printer HP OfficeJet 8015e. Sometimes it tell me to “check for errors”.  Still not sure what that means. The support technician said I should unplug it and plug it into an unprotected (non surge protected)  outlet.  I tried that I still get the error.  It is printing ok just not sure what that means and I didn’t get an error code. If it persists I will call tech support again.

I have had many printers from Hp and some very expensive ones when I was in business. I am retired now for 17 years. I am now on a fixed income. I hope you won’t be charging me for cancelling one day after the monthly period. I had not used the printer at all after that monthly time period. The agent at “instant ink” ( when cancelling) said I wouldn’t be but in that email attached #3 says I will get a final bill. I don’t think this is fair. Can you please correct this?

Respectfully ,

Betty Ann Tweedy."

However, the printer itself has some features that are not so desirable.  You cannot scan or fax as it doesn’t have a top loading tray.  The paper tray is in an awkward spot as the paper coming from printer is right on top of paper tray.  It suits what I need for now but wish I would have added more questions before purchasing.  I love HP products just wish this had more suitable features for me."

It was really irritating when we installed it because instructions did not indicate starter cartridges were included, so got cartridges and the printer would not accept them--finally realized there were starter cartridges--had been overlooked in the unpacking process, and the printer would only work with them.  Then later when we installed the other cartridges, the printer would not accept them, presumably because they had been opened before installation, though not sure."

The printer was advertised that it came with 6 months of free ink once you sign up with InstantInk. After signing up I was advised that I get only 2 months of free ink. The contents of the box say 6 months free ink as well. That took an hour of my time including sending screen shots to HP support to actually get the advertised 6 months free ink. So extremely poor implementation of an offer that only leaves your customers pissed off. Next, the warranty shows only 9 months left even though I only bought the printer 3 days before and it's advertised to come with 24 months warranty once registered. Again, another hour on the phone with HP support and scan and send receipt and I still have to speak with support tomorrow to confirm the advertised warranty is applied. When speaking with support I let them know that they are sending me French only support email and to switch it to English - which the 300 items I had to fill out over and again clearly state. Today I was sent another email entirely in French. HP has wasted about 4 hours of my time in order to fight for things that are advertised as ""free"". My time is not ""free"" HP. I would say lights are on but nobodies home at HP."

378889516,Others,positive,0.6032015085220337,"Very easy set up start to finish. The online and printed instructions walked you through the process step-by-step. Connecting my various devices to the printer was easy as well.

Also, I am assuming that the print heads can be replaced as they had to be installed with the set up.  My previous ink tank printer's print heads failed and you had to disassemble the machine to replace them which made it impractical to replace them over buying a new printer."

I returned the printer.
Got me an Epson"
378890588,Product Quality,positive,0.7246645092964172,Looking forward to new long-lasting ink. Printer a little noisy when it feeds ink to print heads. Protective packing piece for print heads difficult to remove at setup.
378892532,Product Quality,positive,0.5949260592460632,"Pros: The printer is a nice design and I like that the ink is visible at the front.  The print quality is good and the ability to print from the phone via the app is very easy! 

Cons: It is very slow to print a page and to print double sided you have to turn the page yourself.  Had I known this I would not have chosen this printer. The set-up took some time and I struggled but eventually got there. 

Overall it's not bad but be mindful of the negatives."

Instant Ink was absolutely not worth the money spent.

It constantly has issues thinking it’s low on paper when it’s not, ink low when there’s still ink, or simply not working for unknown reasons. The standard troubleshooting is not adequate. It usually does not solve the problem. This all probably leads most people to believe they need to pay for the extra services so they can get help. A printer should have support because a company stands behind their product, not so they can milk more money from their customers. These printers are generally for non-business individuals who don’t want a subscription for maintenance and troubleshooting etc. I just want a decent printer for home use without all the hassle. I never know if it will be smooth printing or more than an hour troubleshooting and maybe eventually being able to print. (Unfortunately, and sadly, this is not unique to this printer or company. I don’t remember the last printer we’ve had, HP or otherwise, that really worked well.)"

 The high cost per copy is not acceptable.

 I'm honestly thinking about switching brands; despite working exclusively with HP for 25 years. I started with a 500, went to a 690, a 6127, ..., until ENVI.
 For the first time I'm thinking about changing brands.

379892917,Customer Service,negative,0.7903991341590881,"The HP agent was very impatient with my responses. She would send multiple messages trying to rush a response from me. When she would some time to respond, I did not rush her response time at all. At the end, she even disconnected the chat due to her impatience. She was not even capable of answers all of my questions and by the time she disconnected, I still had more questions. 

I still do’t understand the whole purpose of HP+. From my understanding, I have to pay in order to use the ink. If I don’t pay for the ink that the printer already came with, then HP will have my account suspended. What’s the point of having the ink come with the printer if you still have to pay to use the printer after? 

In order for this new printer to be used, I was charged for prior balances on my account that I didn’t even know I had. I was never made aware of any prior balances until I got this new printer. I still don’t even know what the prior balances were for because it is not stated anywhere. How it is even possible to have prior balances? In order for there to be a prior balance, that means that I was supposed to pay for a service or product. Assuming that I did in fact receive a service or product, how did HP allow that without me paying? It doesn’t make any sense to me.

When I was charged for whatever prior balance was there, apparently I wasn’t even charged the full amount at one time. Which again, doesn’t make any sense to me. HP was not transparent about the amount of money that was supposed to be paid. I was charged for one prior balance amount one day, then the next day I was charged for the other prior balance. By the way, Elize said that I would have to re-enter my card information for my card to be charged again. That makes absolutely no sense. 

I was supposed to receive Instant Ink for 6 months for free according to HP. According to Elize once the second balance was paid, she could give me a credit that would offset the payment for this month. If I am supposed to have Instant Ink for 6 months free, why would I need to pay for this month? Under my HP account, it says that I won’t be charged for Instant Ink until September. This whole exchange and switch over to this new printer is more of a headache than anything else."

First, you're too cheap to put paper manuals with a new purchase. Install instructions were terrible and took a long time. It hasn't worked now for 3 months and I don't know what the lights mean. No black when I last tried to print. Replacing it was no help and now it just wont do anything. It's nothing but an anchor holding the desk down."

Also, the touch screen is smaller and it's easier to ""fat finger"" the wrong selection.  Also don't like that the default to copy is ""color"" vs. ""black"" ink.

I got as far as filling the ink tanks and fitting the printheads, but then no alignment page was printed.

I had not applied any kind of force or pressure, so I can’t see how this happened, but it was relatively easy to click the plastic clip back in (it also clicks out of place rather too easily!).

380302407,Others,negative,0.8849429488182068,"Users cannot print with black ink if any of the color ink cartridges are depleted. Without color ink, the printer becomes useless.

Color ink cannot be purchased in a single cartridge.  Three separate cartridges are required, and each is quite pricey.

Without 4 ink cartridges, the printer setup process cannot be completed.

Cartridges that clearly HAVE ink are designated as depleted.

Ink depletes quickly.

Printer setup is difficult and the screen instructions are insufficient.

Once the printer receives a default name during setup, and name change by the user requires rerunning the complete setup from scratch.  The ""printer not shown"" feature on the device itself does not allow synching to the printer identified in the device list on the computer.  Using the ""adding a printer"" feature on the computer does not update the printer options automatically.

Multiple problems with the scan feature.  ""Device not recognized.""  ""Scanning unavailable.""  Scan settings were established to open the document upon the completion of scanning; document did not open.  Document did not save to the designated folder."

So today I called back in and was transferred 3 times before I finally was connected to someone who understood my dilemma and promised to help me.  At this point I’m 45 minutes into this call but was happy to finally have someone assist me only to be told oh I’m sorry but your warranty expired last week.  I explained that I didn’t want another warranty, I just needed someone to assist me with changing whatever needed to be changed so that I can use regular HP ink instead of instant ink.  I escalated 4 times only to be told by each supervisor the same thing.  You need a warranty for service after I repeatedly told them that I just needed to know how to make my $300 1-year old printer work with my $60 HP ink.   Finally I got to@a “case manager”
Who was beyond rude. She also repeated told me I need a current active warranty or pay a one time fee for assistance to which I replied that I would never purchase another HP product after this experience and will definitely not need a warranty.  She refused to escalate my call to her supervisor.  By this time I was 1:45 into the call.   I finally gave up and told her I would be contacting the corporate office regarding this issue.

The so called manager also lied when he said, “ We wish that we could make you happy.” 

I suggested they reimburse us for the difference in the printed that truly was the one that replaced his old printer. It  should have been  in the 8000 series. He kept trying to give me free ink or an extra warantee. Useless crumbs. 

We are on the HP ink program so basically he offered worthless solutions.

Also found Tech Buildz to be a highly suspect company referral. I honestly think I was scammed by them from the beginning. And I do not appreciate it all their way of collecting a fee. Producing a check and falsely signing it on the back and submitting it to me is illegal. But also way to avoid a credit card company coming back on them for false or erroneous charges. I feel I was totally duped because I was desperate to get a printer up and running and after you invest at least an hour or two you want to see it through to the end. However when they wanted to charge and exorbitant fee for virus protection I became more convinced this was all a scam. Adding insult to injury the quality of the print on this printer actually stinks. I am very unhappy with his purchase and I'm seriously considering returning it. I am also unhappy that in the process of supposedly debugging my computer they signed me up without my permission for the ink program which I would never have agreed to and they deleted my existing virus protection. Making me more suspicious of all that went on that day. It is if you are in cahoots where you let them scam a user to buy and use your printer with no choice in purchasing printer ink.

It is just annoying that it keeps going back to that message. It doesn't seem quite a finished product."

380829059,Customer Service,negative,0.7272868752479553,The printer was easy enough to set up. I had a slight problem setting up instant ink because I had a hp printer on the same WiFi  previously. I was scanning pages two days ago and the printer became undetectable after some pages being scanned. I had to power cycle the printer before it could reconnect. If not for this I had perfect service so far.

I spent too much time on the phone and I am still without a working printer.  My printer is still under warranty.  HP sent a refurbished printer and I am still waiting for new in carts bc I have the ink plan and they carts were locked.  The rep said I would have it by yesterday.  It's still not here.

380833678,Others,negative,0.9135670065879822,"I have never had so many issues with a printer than I have with HP printers. I will never recommend them to anyone. I had an HP 2700 series and it would constantly disconnect from my devices and I’d have to go through the set up steps to get it to print. Then it started pulling the paper into the feed a bunching it up. It was impossible to print after that. I couldn’t even scan a document and print it. I called HP and they replaced it. I get my new replacement printer an 4100 series and get it set up. It works great for a lot two weeks, then it stops connecting again to any device. I spend hours on the phone calling to get this resolved. HP determines it is faulty and needs replaced so they replace it with another brand new 4100 series. This printer lasts a week, I never could get it hooked up to the instant ink service and it also has connection issues. Two days ago I was trying to print something and it wouldn’t print, wouldn’t show in the que I even sent a print. I tried on my phone. I tried on the app. Nothing. Then 4 hours later it printed! Yesterday it stopped connecting once again I was on hold for 3 1/2 hours and they couldn’t figure it out and then had to escalate my case but had to send a picture of my error message. They took an hour to receive my picture I emailed. In case you can’t tell I’m extremely frustrated. HP printers suck. Hands down. I will never recommend. I need a printer for my business and for school. I had an Epson before this for years and after it bit the dust I thought I’d try the HP. Never again. I have wasted hours of my time on hold and trouble shooting. Worst printers ever. If you want to have a consistent printer… don’t buy this."

380841005,Customer Service,negative,0.8621239066123962,I have had to replace my printer prematurely twice because it hasn't been worth paying to have it looked at when I could buy another for similar cost and not be inconvenienced by having to find someone to look at it and then wait. This last time I repeatedly went through all the fixes for the error message I received and eventually gave up as I was told it was most likely a hardware error. When I bought the new printer I put in the old ink cartridges (and I have ALWAYS used genuine ink) I received a message that one of the cartridges could be damaged. I may have bought a new printer because of a damaged ink cartridge! The only reason I replaced my HP printer with the same printer is because I had $150 of ink in my cupboard.

He tried several things but nothing would work. He spoke to his supervisor and the suggestion he came back with was for me to send  this printer back and they would send another one. That would mean I was going to be sending the broke printer back as well as the new replacement printer.  That was not acceptable.  I needed a printer and I had waited for about a week for the replacement printer.  I did not want to hear that I had to wait 7 days to two weeks for another printer.  He went and spoke with his supervisor and returned with a method of overriding the preprogrammed printer.  To my pleasant surprise it worked.  The representative named Aamir refused to give up.  His heart was in helping me the customer with the printing problem that was created by the people responsible for shipping a replacement printer to me without the specially programmed ink cartridges. We spent a lot of time on this issue and I was exhausted after we finished but I was happy that I was lucky enough to get Aamir who was determined to help me get this printer started. He got 6 stars from me.

The second representative did a great job as well because the next day the printer wouldn’t print.  He too was very thorough. He found the problem and took off the baggage  electronically that was preventing the printer from printing.  Both men were examples of excellence from your company!!!!!

381656777,Others,negative,0.7158536314964294,"I have had HP printers for years and my biggest issue has been related to the HP Instant ink subscription service.  I typically buy a much higher end printer than needed to get some of the additional features, but printing usage it very low, under 100 pages a month typically so a printer rated for 2000 pages a month should last me forever. But the issue is once in a while with past printers I would get locked out because of the instant ink subscription and it typically would require support to get it back online.  Not only does this take a couple of hours or more when this happens, once the printer is more than 2- or 3-years old. support wants to push toward upgrading the printer, which really irritates the hell out of me, since my printer has only printed 2000 pages in that time when it is rated for that per month.  
The last time this happened in November 2023 I decided it was time to upgrade and went with an Epson product after visiting with the manager at the local Office Depot store and explaining my frustration.  The Epson worked fine for 5 months, but last week it did an update and the new driver actually looks the only print from devices on 2.4 Ghz WiFi, this is true even if the printer is connected via CAT5, it simply will not print if my pc is connected to the same subnet on 5 Ghz WiFi. I spoke to support and the tech said that is the way it is designed to work.  And to test it I connected it via CAT5 with my laptop on the 5G WiFi and i would get an error every time. If I switched to the 2.4G WlFi the document would print and error clear.  So back to Office Depot it went under the Satisfaction Guarantee clause. And I am back to the HP with instant ink and hopeful the connection issues are resolved, and I do not have that issue going forward.  Time will tell, but one thing for sure Epson is out, once and done!"

381775801,Others,negative,0.9577550888061523,"I am filling against HP for false advertisement and mental anguish. Hp's ENVY Pro 6458 received a firmware update rendering it inoperable due to medium levels of ink. HP now demands that all it's printers ink cartridges are always completely full or the machine will not function. Even ink-free processes such as scanning are disabled if anyone does not meet HP's new mandatory ink & paper level, which must be completely full at all times. Due to their unethical, illegal business practices, I've been forced to file a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau. The BBB had spoke with HP, and HP's 1st agent I spoke with admitted that I was not supposed to receive the illegal firmware update because I bought my printer before this illegal practice, price gouging, and other offences were quietly snuck into HP's victim's peripheral via unauthorized firmware update. I have now incurred an exponential loss of work, money(from the lost work), mental, emotional, and physical trauma due to this crime. I have Multiple Sclerosis, this hack/scam preventing me from using my HP ENVY Pro 6458 All-in-One Printer had now caused an MS attack. My left side of my body is in pain, especially my left leg and foot. This premeditated attack by HP was caused by HP's attempt to force me to buy even more new ink (which I do not need at present, I have plenty of ink) but since I can't do this HP shut down all process on my HP ENVY Pro 6458 All-in-One Printer.

Historical problems and not resolved despite numerous calls to tech support:
I owned a HP Officejet Pro 8620 for seven years and love it! In 2022, while printing, it asked for the yellow cartridge to be changed. I did this, then, it wanted the cyan cartridge changed. I changed it. Then, “Printer failure. There is a problem with the printer or ink system. Turn printer off, then on. If problem persists, contact HP.”
I turned the printer off/on. Didn’t help. Replace the new cartridges with another set of new cartridges, removed and re-inserted all of the cartridges. Still getting the same error message. Went on-line to tech support and through the diagnostic question process, with, what seemed like a robot. The result was, sorry, we cannot find a solution to your problem.
Checked listed service centers. Staples. Called Staples. They do not fix printers and could only send them back to the factory but only if still on warranty. The printer is 7 years old…not on warranty.
Asked about similar printers in stock and they had an HP Officejet Pro 9025. Went and bought it.
Set it up, went on line to complete the installation, (not an intuitive process by the way). I tested printing, copying and scanning with a word document. It would print and copy but not scan. Need to download some other driver. (The box says print, copy, scan and fax. It should do all of this ‘out of the box’ with just ONE download!)
Went on line again. Found the software. But would not let me download it unless I:
-	Opened an account
-	Signed up for something called HP Smart
-	Signed up for the ink
Did all that (under protest!!)
Driver started to install. Got “stuck” and then message that it could not find the device! What?!
Went into my test word document to check out printing ….. HP 9025 no longer listed in the print window! What?!
Opened control panel and checked list of printers. HP 9025 listed but “no driver installed”! What?!
Noticed another printer listed “HP Smart”. Huh?
Went back to the word document and found HP Smart listed as a printer. Selected it and (yet another) window asking me to confirm printing to the HP 9025. It is the only printer I have connected…it has to ask? Printed OK.
Wondered if the scanning would now work, so selected scan from the printer and yes, it scanned the document and sent it to my computer. However, unlike the 8620, it did not give me an opportunity to select the output format. Opened the scanned document on my computer. JPEG. Hit the drop-down file format menu. TIFF, PNG, no PDF!
So how do I scan as PDF?
All of the above occurred shortly after buying the 9025 in 2022. Since then I have had numerous problems, mostly with scanning, but also with ""off-line"", or ""printer can't be found"" messages. I have made numerous calls to tech support (check my file). For some reason I now have TWO HP 9025s coming up on the list of available printers. One of them says ""copy"" and it is the only one that works. My experience with your tech support people has not been good either. They seem to bumble around, not knowing really how to fix a problem, just shooting in the dark till something sort-of works.
The scanning problem is persistent. When I scan to computer, three devices are listed. One does not provide the PDF option. The second does provide the PDF option, but when I scan I get a message on my computer ""printer not found"", which doesn't make any sense at all since it is the printer sending the message. The third device doesn't work at all. I figured out a work-around for the persistent scanning problem. I scan to a USB as a PDF then manually transfer the scan to my computer. Not ideal but it works."

Last year I made a big mistake and bought a cannon printer, I could not set it up.  Had to pay for a set up, but it kept going off line. I paid way more than I have ever paid for a hp, had to buy ink almost as soon as I had it set up for the third time. Paid more for the ink than I do with hp. Long story short. The printer is now in the garbage!  Will never buy another printer that is not hp, I also made sure anyone who asked me about my printer preferences that hp is the only way to go."

Scarlet was EXTREMELY patient, and even kept our connection while I took half an hour to eat lunch. Connecting my Google chrome laptop and then my iPhone took almost three hours, but without her taking over with the Rescue App to assist me there is no way I could have figured this out on my own. I also really liked the fact that it was all done in writing, so I could see and refer back to what she was asking. It’s bad enough to be hard of hearing and then having to talk to someone who may have a heavy foreign accent that is hard to understand. I am also really going to enjoy the ink program - one less thing to have to run out and get at the last minute! And the print quality is excellent! Terrific service!"

382255342,Product Quality,positive,0.8584902882575989,My last HP printer lasted over 10 yrs and is still working fine except I can’t find ink for it. So I bought the new one. It prints both sides and is wireless. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
382256598,Customer Service,negative,0.7962018251419067,"1.Your instructions are a nightmare that cause more problems than they solve! 2.You're free 3-month trial was another nightmare! I followed the directions and I started the instant ink subscription. Then it told me to input a claim code for my free 3 months. but there was no claim code in the box. there was no claim code on the box. there was no claim code on any of the paperwork, not even the pink flyer that said "" 3 free months""  on it there was no code anywhere! I bought a code from Amazon for $5.Now explain to me how $5 equals free! 
3. So the Amazon code worked. Got the printer all set up. And the first 45 pages you print it out perfectly I'll straight up when you look at the app to preview and put it out exactly like that. Then the next page I printed printed upside down and backwards. I wanted it to print in the top right hand corner of the page. But instead it printed in the bottom left hand corner of the page where I already had something printed so that ruined both of those projects. and I have very limited paper! In between a bright pretty page and down and backwards pretty page I had not touched any buttons on my phone or on my printer there was nothing touched to change to position of the page printing! So I called your tech people. 
4. The first tech that I talked to on the night of April 20th was extremely helpful polite and willing to put in whatever time it took to try and fix the problem up to the point to where I was getting too sleepy to keep going! So he set up for a phone call the following date. Well the tech who called me had none of those attributes! He's been very little time trying to assist me and did very little to try and find out what the problem was he kept telling me that the free 3 months trial was automatic with the printer and I did not need to have a code which was wrong because it wouldn't go to the next page without me you putting in a code And then he kept telling me that the upside down printing issue was a problem with the Samsung phone and that I needed to contact Samsung and tell them that it was their issue to deal with it because it was he said it wasn't a printer issue !! I had counted on HP! My dad bought HP printer laptop He's gone now and I still have his HP laptop All of his office electronics were HP so seeing that I assumed it was a quality company! I thought I could count on them to stand behind on what they sold! But I guess you really get what you pay for. I bought my printer on Amazon on a special sale for $35 it's that I had the best deal ever made! Sad she realize that all I bought was a $35 nightmare!"

382507837,Others,negative,0.4355076253414154,"Honestly I think the HP Plus program is criminal, not the ink refill program I think that's great The HP +. Why do I think that? 
 It's because my printer was working fine yesterday while working from home, I'm on a hybrid schedule and work 3 days a week from home, I needed to print multiple documents and a couple of them printed satisfactorily.  As I tried to print one from my phone I used HP Smart, it asked for my PIN number for my printer it's a  HP Office jet pro 8030 I believe. I just purchased at Costco less then 8 months ago. First time I ran out of ink I found some HP ink cartridges at local store and reinstalled them.  They worked fine.  I ran out a second time the HP cartridge run available at my local store so bought some ink off Amazon, wasn't the cheapest I could find, it seemed to be high quality ink, five-star reviews, put it in carts...I received a message that they weren't genuine HP, and I accepted it.  Printer worked fine for days.  Jump to yesterday printed a document worked okay then I need to print one for my phone and here's where the trouble began.  I installed the HP smart app trying to print from my phone and ask me to I put in pin #.... I found the PIN number in the printer and hit okay, then a message abouton the HP + pops up I got ok and now my printer is bricked. I was on the phone for 3 hours yesterday trying to unsubscribe from HP + so I could print important documents for work!  The gentleman created a case number 512-301-3147. I was unable to print important work documents and water hrs of my Friday evening!  As you can imagine it was extremely frustrating.  Though it says if you're not happy with HP Plus you can pause or cancel anytime apparently you cannot. 
Again 3 hours discussing this to me that's criminal acts as my Printer somehow got immediately flashed and now would not print for my phone or my PC.  The min I hit ok on HP+ it flashed my printer to no longer accept the cartridges that were in there and working fine.  I told the employee to cancel it I asked him to ward my avoid my warranty that I didn't care I just needed to print a document I was transferred to another gentleman nobody would cancel my HP Plus membership I asked if I could delete my HP account and create a new one and reboot my printer he was of zero help there essentially told me there's no way it's impossible to cancel which I don't believe to be the case due to the verbiage in the agreement and the fact that it's a method of HP locking customers to use their ink, which again I actually prefer HP ink and would have bought it didn't have it available at the store You can understand how frustrating this is.  Eventually I put in the empty old HP carts. 
 The resulting printed documents looked horrible but it was my only choice again after 3 hours of conversation. I've had five HP laptops, HP desktops.  My current JP Envy 360 convertible I thought was a great computer aside from it's unbalanced weight, my previous DV6 again thought was a great computer, My last HP printer worked great, but I tell you 100%, that at this point I'll never buy an HP product again. Now, apparently my case hasn't reached full resolution after our 3-hour conversation and resetting the printer three times I still couldn't get it to print anything again and the high quality aftermarket carts had ben working fine.  I completely understand you want everyone to buy your ink and it could void the warranty, but it was a $200 printer I would happily buy another one getting these documents printed was much more important in 3 hours of my time worth much more than $200.  
After digging through your pages and during this 3-hour conversation I found a statement that there's no added cost to sign up for HP Plus. You just need to own supported HP printer and use genuine HP ink or toner. Plus if you decide you aren't delighted with HP Plus, you can change, pause, or cancel it at any time at no cost."". Well apparently my computer printer has been flashed with some type of software that your employees are unable to remove and I now have a paperweight until I can find some HP ink which at this point I refuse to do. I even asked a gentleman just to send me a few ink cartridges overnight so I could print them the following morning and regrettably he would not do so I guess we'll see where my case goes but my current plan is when I have my garage sale in May to sell all my HP products and head back to Costco to purchase new printer new laptop new desktop etc. Not even sure if you guys read these things but that's my story"

382655845,Product Quality,negative,0.8649376034736633,"Printers don't need to be this complicated.  You didn't supply a cord to connect to older computers that don't have WiFi abilities and I'm NOT paying a monthly fee and then be limited to how many pages I can print, or pay a fee even if I don't use up those pages.  I'll buy my ink as I need it.  If I knew all of this, I wouldn't have gone with it.

Also, the top document feeder isn't working too well, there is no instructions to tell you to place the document face up or face down, you have to figure it out.

It also doesn't tell you which top corner to line up your scanner glass scans.

Overall, the printer doesn't live up to my expectations.  The ""alignment"" page didn't copy and print as clearly as the original, which does not bode well for scans that I need to print out.

I'm retired now, live on social security only and one month I might print two pages, next month I might print 200.  (Unlikely, but it could happen).

The last is not your fault, I wish I'd have gotten it in black, I didn't open this printer for 2-3 months after buying it, and I just bought a new desk, all black. :("

382727769,Others,negative,0.4195912778377533,"The wireless setup should be an easier process, it should take minutes rather than hours.  My printer connected to a wireless card on my desktop over Bluetooth due to the  proximity of my desktop.  Luckily I have an IT back ground in desktop support so connecting laptops/PCs to printers was just a matter of troubleshooting the issue after 2 hours, I was getting a little frustrated, but having patience is part of my job. 

A friend of mine however, had a similar issue with one of your new HP inkjet wireless printers, which she purchased this year, she was so frustrated when she asked me to help, she was going to return the print device.  After 2 hours, I finally, had to download software from the HP support website and connect a USB cable from her printer to her laptop.  Only after this, we were able to have the laptop communicate with the printer.   So first thing you need to do is fix the wireless issue.  You will lose sales if you don't.  Better instructions should be included especially what possible cables may be needed, to complete setup.  I know you asked about my printer but there are older people that don't necessarily have an IT background and they will return the equipment rather than trying to understand an offshore technician over the phone.    

My printer once I got it connected works well, whether I use my phone, tablet, desktop, and laptop. It uses hardly any ink for even the most color graphic print outs.  Very economical, if someone tells me they are considering buying another printer and they're even thinking about an inkjet, I tell them to consider a tank printer.  My last printer was an HP Officejet that lasted for 7 years.  I originally paid $100 for it brand new out of the box.  The after costs in buying ink cartridges, probably brought my ""$100"" to a ""$1,100"" printer.   

The tank printer is a little more expensive, up front cost but I was willing to pay as much as $275 for a printer.  I know I would have already paid $120 in ink if I had purchased the inkjet.  My tank printer has just recently got to the point were, I can see the level of ink in the ink display windows.  I figure I will need in maybe late Dec 2025 or early Feb 2026."

No matter how many times I re entered the new bank details the suspension would not lift, I tried to get help via the chat bot and was told to keep re inputting my bank details. In the meantime I really needed to print documents for work, so I stupidly bought another printer from HP because that was the only one I could find in the rural area I live. This one is a nightmare it just doesnt print, so now I have two virtually new printers, ink cartridges but I can't print. THANK YOU VERY MUCH for your terrible service."

The printer would not recognise the page sizes most often used in my work areas and suffered paper jams when asked to print on A4 paper. This was resolved when I informed the system the I was German,
Otherwise, I find it very useful, with easy-to use features such as images per page and image orientation. I have not had time to examine its performance regarding colours."

I will think twice before I buy another hp printer.  This is disappointing because we use them in our corporation and I have always used them in my home.  If my staff had as much trouble installing them, we will discontinue there use as we replace them.  I cannot pay for that much employee time for no return.

I purchased this HP 2855 for $100.00 as a gap printer while I am remote from my home. 
1. It was remarkably easy to set up
2. The print speed is outstanding.
3. For the price, this printer put out a printed document that beats my far most expensive MFC by a mile! 
4. I had no idea it printed in color or was a multi function machine! 

Love it!"

Additionally, although the ""never run out of ink"" service is interesting, I don't print that much in a month.  I guess I could let you know when I run out of the ink that came with the machine.  One more thing - it only gave me one choice of network, we have several and would prefer to use a different one."

The auto-delivery is a great idea for people who use their printer a lot, but I print very rarely.  Therefore, I will probably cancel my subscription within the 6 months.

 You are also required to stand with your laptop next to your printer. If you press the touch key to scan from another room, your document is not immediately propelled, you need a dock. give it a push, in the end you have a thick black border at the top and a part is missing at the bottom that has not been scanned.

1.Even if printer is connected in wireless network it doesn't print, only once and never again.

3. Printing 5 colored page is always having missing colors on the 4th or 5th page, always even when bought new.
4. At around 2nd month of use yellow is always missing when printing, even if ink is original, i always have to dampen the printhead with wet tissue for it to work again then after a few prints it needs to be done again and again.
5. Printer is very slow, after plugging in it preps itself for a minute or two like a fuckin girl doing makeup, i needed to print a document fast and it preps itself again after a single print. I should've  bought an epson!"

The buttons are not user friendly. Who wants to go fetch a manual every time they want to use a button. And getting a printout for every time you press info is a waste of paper.
It is a waste of time trying to connect the printer through the computer, just use a phone.
The only nice thing about the printer is the cheap ink.
Disappointed that it was marketed as a small office printer, it is for home use only by 1 person. The rollers are already done and copy function messes with the software. 
With everyone saving paper, all documents are usually printed 2 sided, why can't your small ink tanks do double sided scanning & coppying automatically.
A small office ink tank printer needs DOUBLE SIDED SCANNING & printing automatically & manually. 
Why do you even make printers that can not take a packet of plain A4 paper, 500 sheets, at a time."

Hi Dusan,

I have found the case number from Tech support in January which is 5119517831 and whoever your colleague was i spoke too from instant ink in January, to told me that he had put a note on to add an additional three months onto the nine months free giving me a total of 12months for the inconvenience.

As i explained to him at the time, i replaced the instant cartridge with a new one and my printer had an error saying cartridge jam or words to that effect and when i spoke to tech support they told me the printer had failed and was broken so i purchased the new printer but just before i was about to set up the new printer i tried the faulty one and found it had started working again so when i called technical support again he apologised for telling me the old printer was faulty so giving me the extra 3 months, although i wasn't very happy about it as i had just purchased a new printer for over £180.00 when i didn't have too and i tried to send it back to the company where i purchased it but they would not accept it back due to me opening the box.

Hope this helps and gets resolved.

Regards
Tom wright"

Just because I had a restriction on the estimated number of papers printed per month. My construction company's requirements vary from month to month. So you charge an additional surcharge for going over but do not allow carry over of pages not needed, if my understanding is correct. Best of both worlds for you. Printer works well, very detailed copies and quick. I occasionally have to unplug the unit because of an internal light starts flashing, not sure why or what is causing this issue.

I use to use a printer at home in the 90's it was not like this.  I can buy a new printer with starter cartridges for less or close to the price of cartridges.  When I want to print so.ething it is cheaper to go to the library or office depot to print.  The quality of the printers have deteriorated.  I will use the scanner at times that is about it.  Hp needs to do better.

384805380,Customer Service,negative,0.9105673432350159,"On Friday 4/12/24,my less than 1 year old printer had issues with the paper feed and was grinding.  Called for assistance.  After trouble shooting it with me, he said it was a hardware issue. Then he tried to sell me a new printer with ink. The ink was paramount.  I told him I was under warranty. Told me to take it back to Staples.  Then he tried to sell me a refurbished printer.  Asked for a supervisor who assured me that a new unit would be sent and that it would arrive on Tuesday 4/16.  This took place over the span of more than an hour.  No printer arrived on 4/16 and then the fun began.  One HP employee after another made up stories and gave me incorrect information.  On Wednesday I received an email that the printer was being shipped, albeit to an incorrect address. i immediately called and sent a text correcting the address.  I was told that the address correction had been made and that the unit would be shipped on Wednesday.  NOT SO.   this issue was then sent to escalation where Jhen took over my case. She informed me that the unit was not in stock at the warehouse but was expected  to arrive on 4/22.  I asked for expedited shipping since I would not be at my address in Connecticut passed the end of the month.  I have another residence in Florida.  I was informed that nothing could be done.  Our communication was sporadic at best because I could not leave a message for her at the telephone number that she gave me.  I would send her emails and would wait 2 days to hear from her.  Then Steven, her boss got involved and said that he does not deal with customers.  Interesting, what does he do?  whe I mentioned the problem with leaving a message, he stated that this had been a problem for over a year.  What kindof customer service is this?"
384812891,Customer Service,negative,0.9391182065010071,"I have always used HP printers and this is the first time I have had any problems.
I have spent approx. 2 days of my time trying to get the printer to connect with my laptop. 
Following calls with HP Support I was told to contact my Internet supplier to get 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz separated - this took me several hours & has meant I have had to ""reconnect"" all my Internet-based items (e.g. solar panel battery reports) & even now am having issues with the booster units we have in our bungalow.
On top of all of that, the printer still does not work! On Friday morning I was told to return it to the supplier & that I would get an email to give to them explaining why. As no email had arrived I contacted the Support centre again - only to be told not to do this, but to wait as the issue had been escalated.
In addition, I have received emails (no-reply, which really does not help!) telling me that my case has been closed as you have not had any further contact with me. 
The latest person I spoke with told me that I have a new case number & this is still being worked on. 
Another person this morning told me the problem was with the printer cartridge. This has not been mentioned previously & the cartridge I have was bought with the printer & is an HP cartridge. Also, I fail to see why a faulty printer cartridge would affect the printer being ""seen"" by my laptop.
I am now waiting to see what happens next - meanwhile I am without printer capability.
I have to say that whilst the Support staff have always been very polite & appear to be doing their best, overall I am very disappointed, frustrated & now running out of patience."

The settings box where it should be possible to select colour or black and white is greyed out and not usable. This problem is specific to my iMac. Colour printing is working from my iPad and from a PC on the same local network.
The printer looks great and it was easy to install. However it is not fit for purpose. I would not recommend it for use with an iMac."

So I did and it printed the page and immediately after it printed a page to do a calibration of the printer. So I scanned like instructed and that was the end. So I actually only printed 3 pages but I got an email the next day saying I had printed 12 which is totally wrong!

Both of the cartridges (color and black) were opened. I find this unacceptable. There is no way for me to know if these cartridges are used our not.
384907089,Others,negative,0.5746234059333801,"When I bought us a new HP printer back in late 2022 or early '23, I had no idea at the time the whole thing was going to turn into what for my wife and I essentially has been a huge, stress-inducing nightmare! Here's the deal: We're retired and I'm now disabled and basically no longer able to get around, so just getting over to and/or moving our printer around at all (my wife has to help me with that kind of thing) is a major undertaking. Still, when the print quality started going downhill late last year, my wife let me know about it and I knew it was about time to order more ink cartridges.Not being an emergency, we weren't in any big hurry, but days or maybe even weeks later, it was time to make the effort to get over to our home office area and take care of it. My wife grabbed my crutches and gave them to me so I could get up and over to my walker, then I made my way over to our little home office area, seated myself, fired up the PC, got online and set out to replace the failing ink cartridges. Hmm, it had been a little while since I'd used the thing myself, so I didn't remember what model it was, so I reached over and used the little touchscreen controls on the front to check the settings, which told me it was a Hewlett Packard 8020. Great! I got back on the desktop, logged in to and shopped around online until finally deciding I liked one third-party set (with an overwhelming majority of good (mostly five star) ratings at Amazon.com) and went ahead and ordered them, which was a little less expensive than HP cartridges. As usual, they arrived quickly and without incident in just a day or two, but the printer still printed, so we set them aside until the ink we still had left totally ran out. It really got very little use: my wife and I both were career programmers, so for us, computers were just another tool, and we didn't really use our desktop for entertainment at all, unless maybe the TV zonked out, so it was awhile before replacement proved absolutely necessary. No problem (ha!). Anyway, when I finally decided to install the replacements, which proved to be pretty difficult for me, we were both totally shocked when the printer wouldn't even fully start up, telling me on the touch-screen it would not use the cartridges because they weren't HP (which we knew already!). What the heck? I rechecked everything, online and off, but I couldn't figure it out (at first), other than no matter what I tried, the printer refused to even try using them (although it DID recognize they were all full)! They just wouldn't work, so finally I admitted defeat and tried to go through the Amazon refund process. Nope, that's not happening either! By now it had been more than 30 days since I placed the order and no refund was possible. The reason for that was stupidly simple: we didn't waited until the accursed device wouldn't print at all before ordering more, and it turned out to be longer than expected before we had to! So, after receipt, naturally we waited until we had to change them (my wife and I can't afford to waste money), but that put us outside the Amazon 30-day window to ask for a refund we didn't even know about... What a mess! Okay, so now what? Obviously, we needed still more ink cartridges, which made me angry about having wasted our money on the first replacements, so I got back online and logged in at Amazon again. Time for another huge shock: while double checking everything to make sure I would get something that WOULD work, now I discovered that the ratings for these cartridges had changed for the worse, to the extent that even though more than 50% were still five star reviews, now about 44% were ONE star reviews, all of which stated it was because the printer refused to try using them! This sure smells like a scam to me -- somebody is making a lot of money, and it sure isn't us! Was it HP, because the printer wants ONLY HP cartridges now, or was it the third-party sellers, selling products that wouldn't work but couldn't be returned? Now I really was mad; I always check rating percentages before ordering anything, and at the time of this order, most were glowing five star reviews. Now though, a couple of months later, almost half were one star reviews! What the heck happened!?!?Oh well, basically it didn't matter now. So, with nothing else to be done, I decided to just admit and accept defeat, calm down, and figure out how to order something that WILL work. Instead of relying on what I'd found in my printer settings, this time I went back to our original order detail and discovered the printer was NOT an 8020 model, but an 8025e model, which was NOT supported by the cartridges I'd ordered! Well, now I knew, but why did the printer software tell me it was a 8020? After using a search engine to examine some online photos of HP printers, my wife came over and disconnected everything so she could move the printer around enough to discover the name and model number printed on the lower right side of the front panel, which we couldn't see from the desk. Yep: 8025e. Wow... Why did the onboard software (and what showed up in the desktop PC printer queue or softwareOkay, time to wrap this up before I blow a gasket. After CONSIDERABLE research, I finally ordered what I believed to be exactly what we needed, making sure all of it really was made by Hewlett Packard (one large black cartridge and three standard, smaller color cartridges cost nearly ONE HUNDRED BUCKS, when the stuff I'd ordered before had been under fifty (!!!), and obviously at that time WORKED for the majority of users, most of whom crowed about the money they'd saved!!! ARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!). Hold up now -- deep breath -- get a grip, dude... ;-) Well, we'll know by tomorrow night. These accursed things had BETTER work perfectly or our home printer/fax/copier/etc. is going to learn how to FLY! ;-)So... my wife and I are upset: mad at Amazon, HP and the cartridge manufacturers (at least Amazon now has turned off purchases from them)"

When my free trial ended, I was not going to remain in the ink program because I have never used more than one cartridge of each color a year….ever in my life. I canceled. I then read HPs cancellation policy that the ink you sent would stop working….I only made about 10 copies, so the ink was full.
If I had known this, I would have installed yours and when it was used up, I would have put mine back in. So, now I am on the pause program and when that expires the cartridges will be about 75% full. I would never tell anyone to join your program if they don’t print enough."

The way we've been treated by the team that manages the HP instant ink solution is beyond disgusting and has left an extremely bad taste in our mouth with your company, not only do we or will we not ever purchase another printer from HP again, we also severely boycott all HP products including scanners, computers, laptops, etc. 

We are firm believers and also sharing the negative feedback and activity with as many people as we can. This includes our agents and associates who are former writers and reporters. One of their reputations is great on both the Google and other network of reviews. He has received well over 500,000 views as a very popular reviewer. He alone has written over 10 reviews, very negative reviews of your products experience. Yes we have own numerous printers from your company and because of how you manage The instant ink program We will never buy another printer again mostly because it is wasted so much time and energy dealing with the negativity and the angst of trusting HP and then realizing it was just a scam, never again. Personally I know at least a dozen people that we have prevented from becoming an HP customer. 

Hopefully one day HP will learn from this mistake and try to fix it. We have found many many similar stories online. We as a company take this very very seriously which is why we are so very passionate about sharing this type of horrible experience with others so they also do not experience and go through what we had to."

I think I eventually had to reinstall all the software.  HP scan was always problematic, although now it can scan using Microsoft's scan interface.  This printer also goes through some noisy and relatively long setup process before actually printing; this description is vague because I have no idea what's going on and the printer doesn't provide any messages.  And its ink cartridges have very VERY bizarre packaging--I actually had to call HP to find out how to open the packaging and install the cartridges, because it seemed like the logical way to do it would either damage the cartridge or break the printer.

That said, once all the problems were resolved, ir has been a good machine.  It does a good job printing, it's quick, it offers good options for printing and copying--I really like the copy resizing function--and has had no issues for the last two years.

So I opened up an aftermarket HP black ink for your printer and it didn’t recognize that one either. Turns out I was not able to return that ink because it was bought  as a duo and the black had been opened. Thanks. I did return the printer for an even exchange Thank you so much and the exact same model second printer kept getting paper jams. I live 45 minutes away 90 minute round-trip twice to return the same printer because it didn’t work with multiple issues and was left unsatisfied with the policy of being unable to return the extra ink purchased. I’m now on my third printer and it’s not an HP.

I was extremely disappointed that my extra 962 ink cartridges would not work in the new printer that uses 938 even though they are both the same size. Now I am stuck with useless brand new 962 ink. Will you replace the 962 with 938s?"

385605980,Others,negative,0.8533781170845032,"It took three weeks to set up this printer.  It printer instructions make certain assumptions that may not be true in every case.  In the case of this printer, HP assumed that a wireless set up was possible.  However, my printer is located in my office in the kitchen, and the router is at least 35 or 40 feet away in an upstairs closet.  It is not possible to move either one.

My old printer was hardwired to my old computer via ethernet.  Your online instructions suggest that this is a possibility for HP Officejet8015e, so I went to Best Buy to buy an ethernet cable and a converter--$50.  I brought them home, only to find that this particular printer doesn't have an ethernet port.

Because I could find no further instructions from HP (and because I am really not a fan of ""chats""), I made an appointment with Best Buy Geek Squad (more money), loaded up my printer, cables, laptop, etc. and went to the store.  They found the necessary cable for hardwire to be a simple USB (only $8.00).  Because your instructions at Hp.123.com insist that I need to download drivers, I asked them to do that for me in store.  Surprise!  The hardwire connection doesn't require the drivers--even the Geek Squad tech didn't know that!

I set up the whole thing at home, and asked to SCAN a document to my computer.  More surprises.  The hardwire allows only printing.  To use any other function on the printer, I had more hoops to jump through.  

CONCLUSION:  While I can now use all the functions I need, this setup was unnecessarily frustrating because of inadequate instructions on your part due to your beginning with unfounded assumptions about every homeowner's router/printer proximity.  This is a simple fix on your part, but until it IS fixed, I would not recommend this particular printer.

A second unrelated assumption on your part is that people working on laptop computers will be willing to sit at a desk hardwired to their printers so that you can gather information about how much ink they use and when to send more.  This is just unrealistic.  I don't know about you, but I work outside on a pretty day and in my easy chair on a bleak one."

The instructions provided were clear, concise, and straightforward, making it easy to get started right away. Additionally, replacing the cartridges was a breeze, and while they may be a bit pricey, they are widely available and offer excellent print quality. Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the performance and reliability of this printer, and I am confident it will meet the needs of anyone looking for a hassle-free printing experience."

385748803,Price,positive,0.5334475636482239,Small and does everything. But it's a little pricy for ink
385749822,Product Quality,positive,0.8251916766166687,The printer doesn't have a tray that juts out. This was very useful for under-counter positioning. The printer has been very reliable for the most part. The only exception was a firmware update that caused the printer to stop working and forced me to roll back and not allow automatic updates. The cartridges are also very expensive. Previous similar HP Printers have failed almost simultaneously and that makes me suspect that there is an element of built in obselescence. I wasn't keen on the height of the scanner sheet feed which makes it difficult to position the printer right up against a wall. Overall I always choose an HP printer.

Cartridges: Too expensive for the number of prints you get—no bang for your buck. 

To replace it is a hassle. The cartridge is more difficult to remove and put back in compared to other HP models.

Average: How to get this to work with HP Smart, it was a bit of a work. Not plug and play, and the software recognized the new printer. Also, when I had a new internet/network box, it was a hassle to get things connected properly. It took me 60 minutes or more. 

Scan and print quality are average, to above average.
The display is good to perfect. Icons are very clear and easy to understand.

It is a nice model for people who hardly print anything. Please make the ink cheaper. Buying a new printer is almost cheaper than replacing those cartridges!"

Result: there was a HP printer problem. So lost 2 new cartridges!! new cartridges needed replacing. Turns out it was a printer problem. Both new cartridges had been recycled.
